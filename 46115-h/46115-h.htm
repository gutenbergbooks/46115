PREFACE
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The narrative of the Second Battle of Ypres was
written on the spot and immediately after the action.
It was not until long afterwards that it was possible
to collect and collate the whole of the battalion
diaries.  The story, therefore, could only be compiled
from the personal reports of the officers commanding
units, and in some cases these were not
available, and certain regiments did not therefore
receive the prominence which was their due.
These regiments will, I am sure, readily
understand that the omission was not intentional, but
due to the impossibility of making sure of all
the details of a great and confused action until
months after the event.  Although the material
has become available, I have decided not to attempt
to rewrite the story.  It is, in its main features,
absolutely accurate, and has the advantage which
must belong to any narrative written within sound of
the guns, and while the impressions of the battlefield
are still vivid to the mind.  I am, in fact, afraid
that any attempt on my part to reconstruct the
narrative would spoil whatever merit it may possess.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, it is necessary, however, to
make good some mistakes in the first volume which
have been pointed out by persons who were engaged
in various actions.
</p>

<p>
The majority of errors occur in the matter of
names, which, in about a dozen cases, have been
given inexactly.  In some cases it has been possible
to make the requisite corrections of initials, rank, or
spelling in succeeding editions.  I particularly regret
the confusion between the two brothers, Sergt. L. G. Newell
and Sergt. F. C. C. Newell, both of whom
took part in the charge at Langemarke.  The
first-named, the older brother, died of his wounds after
that attack, while the second and younger recovered,
returned to the trenches, and won the D.C.M. at
Givenchy.  With reference to the names of
regiments concerned in the Second Battle of Ypres,
the King's Own Royal Leinsters have been named
by a misprint instead of the King's Own Royal
Lancashires, as part of Colonel Geddes' command,
on page 56.  King Edward's Horse should have the
prefix 2nd throughout.  I offer my very sincere
apologies to both regiments.
</p>

<p>
As to the position of various units, it is stated
on page 74 of Vol. I. that Lieut.-Col. Watson, of the
2nd, was employed with his regiment on a dangerous
digging operation to connect a weak point in the
line on the night of April 28th, 1915.  It should
have been added that the entire 1st Brigade took
part in this, the 2nd Battalion being on the left, the
3rd in the centre, and the 1st on the right, the 4th
Battalion digging in the meanwhile a support trench
close in rear.  The omission of the description of
the part played by the 5th Battalion (Colonel
Tuxford) in the Second Battle of Ypres was a
serious one, but this is dealt with in the course of
the next few pages.
</p>

<p>
The only serious accusation of inaccuracy in the
tactical survey of any situation is preferred by those
who maintain that the sketch of the action at
Festubert is wrong or misleading.  I have communicated
with Colonel J. E. Leckie, of the 16th Battalion,
who, as a major, took a prominent part in the assault
and succeeded to the command of the regiment,
when his brother, Brigadier-General R. G. E. Leckie,
was promoted to a brigade.  He assures me that the
sketch of the two positions occupied by the
Canadians in their successive attacks is quite accurate,
and, in fact, it is so.  None the less, it is easy to
see how the idea that there was an error originated.
In an attempt to secure largeness of scale in the map,
the area is unduly limited in its scope.  The
position from which the Canadians attacked is not given,
and the extent to which the Germans were forced
back is only just indicated.  In consequence, the
words "First Canadian Position" might be held to
imply that this was the line from which they sallied
forth instead of the first position they occupied
before they advanced to the final attack on the
orchard.  It is a misfortune if the plan underestimates
the ground won by the 14th and 15th.  No
further serious errors have been suggested so far as
Vol. I. is concerned.
</p>

<p>
Mistakes will no doubt be discovered in the
second volume.  They will be found, however,
to apply to the misspelling of the names of
individuals and to an occasional mistake or doubt as to
the precise position of a particular unit on a certain
date, and not, I hope, to any main question of the
tactics or strategy of battle.
</p>

<p>
The contemporary historian cannot hope to avoid
these errors.  He has at his disposal neither the
leisure nor the information of the writer of after
years.  He must take his information as it comes
to him and trust that rough justice is done, believing
that his honest misjudgments will be cleared up
when the full history comes to be written.  In the
meantime, he may hope to supply material of value
for subsequent examination and use.  But for this
final judgment we may have to wait some years.
In the confusion and isolation of a modern battle
men are acutely aware of their own experiences, and
can have little knowledge of what is passing to the
right or left, while the staff behind have the same
difficulty in discovering what is happening on their
front.  In these circumstances, the eye-witnesses
themselves often disagree.  Even the historians of
the past have not infrequently made mistakes and
waged with the pen as fierce battles over stricken
fields as were ever fought by the opposing hosts with
the sword.
</p>

<p>
There is, of course, one easy way out of these
troubles; it is to have no immediate record, but to
await the official publications of after time.  The
Dominion Government has, and I think rightly,
declared against this policy.  It has been from the
start in favour of publicity so long as there was no
danger to national interests.  It has not concurred in
the suppression of the deeds of regiments or
individuals, believing that in a democratic country the
greatest stimulus to exertion is the knowledge that
one is known and approved by one's fellow-citizens.
Its eye-witness accounts, therefore, set in many
respects the tone for similar publications, and it has
adopted the same liberal view in authorising a
contemporary story.  In another respect, the Dominion
Government has been wise.  Enormous sums were
spent after the American Civil War in collecting
the official records.  The units had been disbanded
and the witnesses scattered to civilian pursuits all
over the country, and the inquiry was in
consequence laborious and expensive.
</p>

<p>
The Dominion Government, warned by this
example, have taken prompt measures to secure from
day to day and week to week full reports of the
movements and actions of all units, at a cost which
is trifling compared with what it would cost in after
years; in this way the framework has been erected
for an official narrative.  This is a prudent measure
which will be endorsed by Canadian students of
history, since there is a growing tendency to demand
a full and intelligent documentary record of our
progress.  All the officers of the Canadian Corps
have in one respect or another contributed to the
collection of these facts, and have done so often
in the face of grave danger and complete
exhaustion, when they might well have been excused
from troubling about such trivialities as to what
posterity would think about them.  The
members of the Record Officer's Staff have been
unwearied in collecting all the available material, and
this common sense of duty has laid the foundation
of our records on a substantial basis of fact.
</p>

<p>
For all mistakes which occur, and more particularly
for the omissions, I, as Record Officer, take
full responsibility, for the Record Officer is no more
exempt than others from the fog of battle.  But I
would point out that my task would be rendered less
difficult, and the chances of error or injustice
diminished, if the commanders of units would supply
exhaustive diaries and reports on all occasions of
importance.  I have particularly in my mind's eye
the case of Brigadier-General (then Lieut.-Col.)
Tuxford, of the 5th Battalion, who with his
regiment conducted a most heroic defence of the extreme
right of the position during the Second Battle of
Ypres.  His regiment was, in fact, the pivot of the
retirement, and, had it given way, very few of the
1st Division would have come back to tell the tale.
The General is well known as a man of action and
a brilliant soldier, and is perhaps, therefore, though
well qualified to write, little disposed to do so, and
so it was long after the stress and confusion of the
great conflict that I became fully aware of the part
that he and his regiment had taken.  Yet his defence
of the Gravenstafel Ridge was a great feat of arms,
well worthy of the 7th Division, the Household
Cavalry, and the Guards Brigade, who had fought
up and down that bloodstained soil against
overwhelming odds in the autumn of 1914.
</p>

<p>
I hope to make all mistakes good in some final
edition of "Canada in Flanders"; if not, posterity
will vindicate any who have been wronged by
accident.  But in return for such confessions as I
have made, I would give one word of warning to
the critics.  The original twelve battalions have
become an army corps, and if one division or
another happens to find itself involved in a great
battle, it is not unnatural that the attention of the
public should be concentrated on its achievements,
failures, or losses, even though the others
are doing their work equally well.  Fortunately,
or unfortunately, the turn of each division comes,
and the 1st is known by Ypres, the 2nd by St. Eloi,
and the 3rd by Sanctuary Wood.  There is enough
glory and enough suffering to go round.
</p>

<p>
My thanks are due to those who have helped in
the production of this volume.
</p>

<p>
To Chapters II. and III., which deal with the
period from the embarkation of the 2nd Division at
Folkestone in September to the beginning of March,
1916, Capt. Theodore Roberts has contributed much
valuable information and material.  So excellent
was it, that I have availed myself of his permission
to insert many passages in the very words that he
employed, and the Canadian public will be a gainer
thereby.  His services were very valuable in the
post he occupied at the Front.  The April and
June operations involved the reading and careful
consideration of a great mass of documents.  To
reduce them to a satisfactory form entailed an
extraordinary effort of intense concentration; for this
work I am indebted to Capt. Maurice Woods and to
Capt. Talbot Papineau.  Capt. Woods in particular
has largely contributed to the fabric of the chapters
which deal with this part of the story.  In placing
these services on record, I must make mention of
Lieut.-Col. Sims, who performed at the Front the
difficult and onerous task of preparing the weekly
<i>communiqué</i> to the Canadian Press and of organising
the collection of the various diaries and other
data with great success, and of Lieut. Bradley, who
was indefatigable in collecting material.
</p>

<p>
The kindness of the public in England, Canada,
and the United States called for fourteen editions
of the first volume of this work within a very few
months.
</p>

<p>
I am encouraged to hope that the attempts to
continue the narrative which I began nearly two
years ago may not be unwelcome.
</p>

<p>
The present volume contains no central drama
quite comparable to that presented by the Second
Battle of Ypres, but I believe it will be found to
present an accurate account of much suffering and
much glory.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The repercussion of the battle of Ypres was
immediately felt in Canada.  It was an event unique
in the history of the Dominion.  The numbers
engaged, the high proportion of casualties, the
character of the enemy, and the desperate nature
of the fighting made the engagement the most
serious military action in which Canadians had ever
borne a part, and the effect upon home opinion was
proportionate.  The American attack of 1812, the
Red River Expedition, the abortive Fenian raid,
and even the South African Campaign, were by
comparison affairs of minor importance.  The Canadian
regiment had indeed made a name for itself at
Paardeberg, and the 7,000 Canadians who volunteered
for service in Africa had set a high standard
of soldierly virtue in more than one engagement;
but as the European conflict dwarfed the struggle of
1899-1902 for the Empire as a whole, so the share
taken by the Dominion in the war against the
Central Powers entirely overshadowed the effort she had
made against the Transvaal and Free State.  Here
at last in the clash of World Powers a new nation
had come into its own.  Twenty thousand Canadian
troops, many with less than one year's service, had,
almost unsupported and wholly outflanked, held their
own for days against the vastly superior numbers of
the most highly trained troops in Europe, who, in
addition to their usual weapons of warfare, had
suddenly and unexpectedly made use of a vile and
inhuman method of attack.  Of these 20,000
nearly one-third were casualties, and the list of six
thousand killed, wounded, and missing came as a
shock to a public which had not been hardened as
Great Britain had been by the battles of Mons, the
Marne, and the Aisne to the colossal sacrifices
involved in war.  So our land grieved her losses, and
set herself to make them good.
</p>

<p>
From each one of our provinces came the same
voice of mingled sorrow, pride and invincible
determination.  The feeling found expression in the
memorial services for the dead held on April 31st in
Montreal, in five churches representing all religious
denominations.  The flags were flown at half-mast
and the troops turned out to attend the services.
"The achievements of our men," said the
Bishop of Montreal, "have brought Canada into a
new and more honourable place in the Empire.
They endured privation, they suffered greatly, and
now they have paid life's greatest tribute with their
lives."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>May 2nd, 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Nor was Great Britain without her tribute.  A
memorial service was held in St. Paul's on May 2nd,
1915, for the Canadians who fell at Ypres.  The
officiating clergy were the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Bishop of London, the Chaplain-General to the
Forces, and the Dean of St. Paul's.  The ceremony
took place not without propriety in the City
Cathedral of St. Paul's; for though Westminster Abbey
is consecrated by long tradition and the immortal
tombs of great monarchs and statesmen of times
almost out of remembrance, yet the shrines of
Saxon, Norman, Angevin, and Tudor kings are a
little remote from the dead of a far-off country with
which these recumbent figures were never
concerned.  But St. Paul's possesses not only the
monuments of the great soldiers and sailors who laid
the foundations of the Empire of to-day, but
enshrines that spirit of patriotic and constrained
freedom which has made the citizens of London both
"the regular army of Liberty" and the firm
supporters of all those statesmen, from Chatham to
Disraeli, who have combined freedom with Empire.
Here the volunteer army of Canada committed to
the Imperial cause would find that its dead might
speak without constraint to those of an older time.
In this temple of a magnificent sobriety was held
the funeral service of the heroes of Ypres.  In the
stiff and formal tombs of their age lay the mortal
remains of Wellington and Nelson, who, if there
be remembrance among the shades, might well have
been present to pay tribute to men whom even they
would have been proud to command.  But round
the walls hung a more significant witness to the
fallen in the countless tablets which still hold the
memories of the soldiers and sailors, now long
forgotten by history, who in many a desperate battle
by sea and land laid the enduring foundations of a
Canada which has proved itself not unworthy of its
origins.  Among these records are those of the City
merchants whose purses and patriotism supplied the
sinews of war to remind us that the great material
resources of the Dominion are not inferior to the
patriotism of its sons, and are no less a vital factor
of national victory.  Here, then, were gathered the
representatives of an Empire united both by pride
and sorrow.  Over the vast assembly which thronged
the building on that dim summer evening the half-lights
scarcely illuminated the interior of the spacious
dome.  As those lights grew and shot up into the
gloom the massed bands opened with the "Dead
March," and a thrill ran through the multitude&mdash;one
of those waves of emotion which only great
occasions can evoke.  The Bishop of London was
the preacher, nor was his eloquence wanting to the
occasion.  "It was on that tremendous day when
French and British had been overpowered by
poisonous gas that the manhood of Canada shone
out like pure gold.  The example of these men
will never die, but will remain as a perpetual
inspiration to their successors."  Those successors
were already on their way.
</p>

<p>
Within three days of the Ypres fight 1,800
reinforcements from the Canadian Training Division
crossed the Channel to bring new blood to the
decimated battalions in Flanders.  The Commander-in-Chief
in France at once dispatched Lieut.-Col. Carrick,
M.P., to ask for a further supply of new
Canadian formations.  The Minister of Militia and
Defence, General Sir Sam Hughes, did not wait for
any request to deal with the instant need.  He called
for a draft of men from the 3rd Contingent, still
training in Canada, to go abroad and help refill the
ranks.  The losses of the 1st Division were thus
partially made good, and it was able now to inscribe
on its banners the proud name of the Second Battle
of Ypres.
</p>

<p>
To the military writer of the future the amazing
feature of the Second Battle of Ypres will always
be the courage and discipline shown by the
Canadians, equal to the best to be found in the armies
with which they were associated.  The greater
proportion of the Anglo-French Armies were composed
of Regular soldiers in the broadest sense of the
term, and it has been held by most military
historians as an axiom that no amount of gallantry and
intelligence can make up for a lack of prolonged
training and discipline.
</p>

<p>
Ordinary military writers put the case even more
strongly.  They maintain in effect that the value of
troops depends on the length of service and on the
character of their training, and on these things alone.
This point of view ignores the other factors which
go to the making of a soldier or a regiment&mdash;physique,
natural boldness and resource, intelligence,
and high patriotic motives; and would
claim that a body composed of naturally inferior
but technically better trained troops could defeat an
equal number of men possessing the qualities I
have mentioned, but deficient in discipline and
experience.  I would submit that the Second Battle of
Ypres does not accord with the expert theory, but
rather teaches the reverse.
</p>

<p>
The late Colonel Henderson, perhaps the best
known of modern historians of war, goes so far as
to countenance the suggestion that had either the
North or the South in the American Civil War
possessed at the start a single army corps of Regulars,
the struggle would have been decided instantly in
favour of its possessors instead of lasting over
four years and necessitating the calling to arms of
the great majority of the citizens of the United
States!  Colonel Henderson states the matter more
moderately in a passage I cannot forbear to quote
at some length, because it embodies the best which
can be said for the professional military point of
view.  Speaking of American Volunteer troops,
Colonel Henderson says:
</p>

<p>
"The Volunteers had proved themselves exceedingly
liable to panic.  Their superior intelligence
had not enabled them to master the instincts of
human nature; and although they had behaved
well in camp and on the march, in battle their
discipline had fallen to pieces.  <i>It could hardly be
otherwise</i>.  Men without ingrained habits of obedience,
who have not been trained to subordinate their
will to another's, cannot be expected to render
implicit obedience in moments of danger and
excitement; nor can they be expected, under such
circumstances, to follow officers in whom they can have
but little confidence.  The ideal of battle is a
combined effort, directed by a trained leader.  Unless
troops are thoroughly well disciplined, such effort
is impossible; the leaders are ignored, and the
spasmodic action of the individual is substituted
for the concentrated pressure of the mass....  The
Volunteers, although on many occasions they
behaved with admirable courage, continually broke
loose from control under the fire of the enemy.  As
individuals they fought well; as organised bodies,
capable of manoeuvring under fire and of combined
effort, they proved to be comparatively worthless."
("Stonewall Jackson," Vol. I., p. 49; Longmans, 1913.)
</p>

<p>
Colonel Henderson quoted in support of his view
the undisciplined advance and disorganised retreat
of the Federal levies at the battle of Bull Run, and
the utter failure of the brave French Territorials of
the Army of the Loire in 1870-71 to relieve Paris
or to make any headway against the Germans when
once the French Regular armies had been destroyed
at Gravelotte, Metz, and Sedan.
</p>

<p>
Such views, by ignoring the real strength which
underlies great national movements and supports
national armies, however ill-trained, lead to that
kind of miscalculation which lured Napoleon to his
destruction in Spain.  They spring chiefly from a
study of those periods in history when small
mercenary or highly-trained bodies of troops existed
side by side with a population whose civic
organisation and patriotic ardour were at a low ebb.  Such
conditions occurred at certain periods of mediæval
history, in the Italy of the Renaissance, and during the
end of the seventeenth and throughout the eighteenth
centuries.  But even in those epochs we can notice
the victories of the ill-organised levies inspired by
Joan of Arc over the highly-trained British men-at-arms
and archers, the successful resistance of Volunteer
troops in Holland to the veterans of Alva, and
the contest waged by the House of Orange with the
levies of the United Provinces against the flower
of the French Army led by Condé and Turenne.
And the system of small, trained armies, and most
of the lessons derived from it, were utterly shattered
by the armed development of the French Revolution.
The Prussian and Austrian Armies which
crossed the French frontiers in 1793 were the last
word in disciplined perfection.  The Prussian Army
in particular was the exact model of the instrument
which, fighting against similar organisations, had
made Frederick the Great.  The French Regular
Army had vanished with the old régime.  In its place
was nothing but a mass of ill-trained, ill-armed,
ill-supplied National Volunteers, whose only strength
lay in a passionate determination to drive the
Invader from the soil which they had consecrated to
Liberty.  The field of Valmy decided the issue in
favour of the Volunteers, or, more strictly, of the
<i>levée en masse</i>, and it was not till the humiliation
of Jena and the slackening of French enthusiasm
for the Napoleonic cause had given Germany the
National Movement which was ebbing from France,
that the military <i>rôles</i> of the two countries became
reversed.  The armies which finally drove Napoleon
back across Europe to abdication and Elba would
have compared unfavourably in technique with the
old Prussian Regulars, but they were armed with
an enthusiasm for their cause which their
predecessors had utterly lacked.
</p>

<p>
The lessons of history receive a startling
reinforcement from the conduct of the Australian and
Canadian troops.  Both were volunteer and
semi-trained troops in the strictest sense of the
term&mdash;and what was true of the rank and file was, with a
few distinguished exceptions, true of its officers and
of its higher command.  Both forces were confronted,
the one in Gallipoli and the other at Ypres,
with circumstances of unprecedented difficulty and
danger.  The landings in the Peninsula and the
fierce fighting at Lone Pine Hill were certainly
operations of an unusual character in war, and just
of a kind, if Colonel Henderson's view is correct,
to bring out the unsteadiness and unreliability of
Volunteer troops, however brave.  The same is true
of Ypres.  Here we find an attack by a new, horrible,
and terrifying instrument of war, accompanied by
a massed assault of the flower of the Prussian Army;
the left of the position becomes a huge gap with the
Canadian trenches in the air.  Communication
between units becomes more and more difficult in the
swaying <i>mêlée</i> of the battle, and the senior officers
are falling fast; supports for many hours there are
none.  If our semi-trained troops had broken under
these combined stresses, who could have blamed them?
</p>

<p>
But in the face of these almost unparalleled
difficulties, the Canadians showed the world an example
of courage, steadiness, and co-ordinated discipline
which could not have been surpassed by that Guards
Brigade which stemmed the German tide in the
first great onslaught at Ypres.  The truth would
appear to be that although, when other factors are
equal between opposing forces, training and discipline
will win, yet there resides in intense patriotism,
high physical courage and endurance bred of
pastimes which are akin to war, and superior
personality, a force which can only be equalled by the
last word in highly-trained infantry.  Sudden and
unexpected emergencies, so far from breaking the
nerves of great Volunteer armies, as they do those
of inferior trained troops, who are confused if the
drill book fails them, bring out the resources of an
individuality not yet crushed by tradition.  The
Volunteer adapts himself more quickly than a
machine-made soldier.

But it is time to turn to the fortune of the 2nd
Division, part of which was already crossing the
Atlantic at the time of the Second Battle of Ypres.
The original offer of the Dominion Government had
been a full division of all arms numbering 20,000.
But the patriotism of the country outran the offer
of the Government, and the actual number of the
first contingent was 33,000 men.  Of these, five
battalions, the 6th, 9th, 11th, 12th, and 17th, had
been left in England when the 1st Division sailed
for France to act as the nucleus of a Drafting and
Training Division.  But even before the 1st Division
had left for England the Dominion Government was
feeling its way towards a further offer.  The day
after the great review of September 7th, 1914, at
Valcartier, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Borden had
cabled Sir George Perley that there were 43,000
men under arms in Canada, and had requested him
to sound the Colonial Office as to the dispatch of a
second contingent.  In the first week of October,
1914, the offer of the 2nd Division of 20,000 men
was made by the Dominion and accepted by the
Imperial Government, and recruiting for it was
started at once.
</p>

<p>
The 2nd Division consisted of the usual three
brigades of infantry, but at the start each battalion
was raised as a separate unit, for the purposes of
enlistment and training.  In fact, in some cases,
companies of the same battalion were raised and
partly trained in separate localities.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Oct., 1914.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The 4th Brigade was for a time under the
command of Col. Denison.  Illness intervened, and
the high hopes of an officer with a splendid record
were completely destroyed.  The brigade then
passed to the command of Brigadier-General Lord
Brooke.  The battalions were recruited from such
well-known regiments as the Queen's Own (of
Toronto), Royal Grenadiers, 21st Essex Fusiliers,
24th Kent Regiment, 28th Perth Regiment, 29th
Highland Light Infantry, 7th London Fusiliers, 14th
Prince of Wales' Own Rifles, 45th Victoria
Regiment, the Brockville Rifles and the
Governor-General's Foot Guards.  Mobilisation commenced
in October, 1914, and the 18th (Western Ontario
Battalion) was commanded by Lieut.-Col. Wigle,
the 19th (Ontario Battalion) by Lieut.-Col. MacLaren,
the 20th (Northern and Central Ontario
Battalion) by Lieut.-Col. Allan, and the 21st
(Eastern Ontario Battalion) by Lieut.-Col. St. Pierre
Hughes.
</p>

<p>
The 5th Brigade consisted of the 22nd (French
Canadians), the 24th (Victoria Rifles), the 25th (Nova
Scotia), and 26th (New Brunswick) Battalions.  All
these regiments began their mobilisation in the latter
part of October and the first week in November,
1914, but they completed it for various reasons at
very different dates.  The brigade was taken over
by Brigadier-General Watson, formerly commanding
the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Division.
</p>

<p>
The 22nd Battalion, under Col. Gaudet, was
recruited entirely from the French Canadians, and
nearly all its officers and men hailed from Montreal
or Quebec.  Its point of concentration was St. John's.
Some two thousand recruits offered themselves, and
of these 1,100 were finally accepted or retained, the
process of enlistment being completed by November 27th.
</p>

<p>
The next battalion of the brigade, the 24th
(Victoria Rifles), Lieut.-Col. Gunn, was mobilised in
Montreal on October 22nd, 1914, but did not
complete its mobilisation until May 8th, 1915.  There
appears to have been a great rush of recruits, no
fewer than four thousand offering themselves.  The
method here was to accept 1,800 men and continue
to weed them out by a process of selection
for several months until the full complement of the
regiment was obtained.  A great proportion of this
battalion came from Montreal, and, like the 22nd,
had carried out most of its preliminary training in
the middle of the winter snows.
</p>

<p>
The 25th Battalion was recruited in Nova Scotia,
including a contingent from Cape Breton.
Lieut.-Col. Le Cain was in command, and Halifax was its
main centre of mobilisation.
</p>

<p>
The 26th Battalion, commanded by Lieut.-Col. McAvity,
was recruited in New Brunswick and
mobilised in the first three weeks of November at
St. John's.
</p>

<p>
The 6th Brigade, which when constituted was
taken over by Brigadier-General Ketchen, was
mainly raised in the West.
</p>

<p>
The 27th Battalion (City of Winnipeg) was
mobilised in Winnipeg and the surrounding districts,
and was almost entirely composed of local recruits.
Lieut.-Col. Snider was in command.  The next
battalion, 28th (North-west), under Col. Embury,
was more composite in its origin.  From Regina came
12 officers and 246 men; from Moose Jaw, 6 officers
and 246 men; from Saskatoon, 6 officers and 228
men; whilst smaller detachments were raised at Fort
William, Port Arthur, and Prince Albert.  It reached
Winnipeg on November 1st, 1,025 strong; and it was
there able to take part in combined training with
the 27th.
</p>

<p>
The 29th (Vancouver) Battalion was raised
entirely in British Columbia and was mobilised very
rapidly in the last week of October, 1914.
Lieut.-Col. Tobin was in command.
</p>

<p>
The 31st (Alberta) Battalion, Lieut.-Col. Bell,
was mobilised at Calgary in November, and was
recruited from that town and from Edmonton,
Medicine Hat, Lethbridge, and Red Deer.
</p>

<p>
The two regiments, which had joined the brigade
in Winnipeg on March 1st, were somewhat handicapped
in battalion training owing to the bad
weather.  However, all ranks were kept hard at work
at platoon and company training, and route marching
was freely indulged in.  The 29th and 31st, on
the other hand, found the climates of Calgary
and Vancouver more fortunate, and were able
to carry out battalion training to a fairly large
extent.[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
The sailing of the second Canadian contingent
was less spectacular than that of the first.
</p>

<p>
The 1st Division had started from the mouth of
the St. Lawrence as a single whole under the escort
of warships&mdash;the most formidable Armada which
had ever crossed the Atlantic.  The 2nd Division
left in single ships and without the picturesque
accompaniments of the first embarkation.
</p>

<p>
The units had been raised separately and were
transhipped separately to their point of union and
divisional concentration in England.  The voyage
was accomplished in safety, and nothing except
speculations on possible submarine attacks relieved
the ordinary routine of the voyage.  A recapitulation
of the dates of arrival of the various units and
of the vessels which carried them would be tedious.
It is enough to say that the transhipment was begun
in April, 1915, was in the main completed by May,
and that the last body arrived in August.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>May to Aug., 1915.</i>
</span>
Although
some of the units did not join up till August, the
division was actually constituted on May 24th, 1915,
the first divisional standing orders being issued on
that day by Colonel Dennison.  On the 25th
Major-General Steele assumed command.
</p>

<p>
The 2nd Division was fortunate in the man who
was appointed to command it.  Major-General
Steele, C.B., M.V.O., had taken part in practically
every event in the military history of the Dominion
since he joined the 35th Regiment of Militia as an
ensign at the age of sixteen during the Fenian raid
of 1866.[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
In December, 1914, he became Inspector-General
for Western Canada, and organised the 6th Infantry
Brigade.  In all these activities he was ably assisted
by Lieut.-Col. Ketchen, whose efforts were
largely responsible for the success of the
recruiting in the West, and who finally took
over the command of the 6th Brigade.  He, too,
like the Divisional Commander, had served in the
North-West and in South Africa, where he obtained
a commission from the ranks.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April to Sept., 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The further training of the units began as soon
as each was landed.  Up till May 25th those
which had arrived took part in the work of the
Training Division at Shorncliffe.  After that date the 2nd
Division was constituted as a separate formation,
and as each battalion, battery or squadron was
landed it was gradually brought up to full strength.
The 2nd Division was, in many respects, more
fortunate than its predecessor.  It had the best of an
English summer, since its time at Shorncliffe ran,
roughly, from April to September of 1915; the high
green downs above that well-known seaside resort
abut on a charming country, and the pleasure of
being able to go into a town was added.  The men
thus avoided the hardships, mud, and isolation of a
winter on Salisbury Plain which had fallen to the
lot of the 1st Division, and they carried away to
France, no doubt, a more pleasant impression of
English weather and scenery.  All these months they
were to be seen tramping the Kentish lanes, the very
picture of health and vigour.  Their work, of course,
was heavy, special care being given to musketry.
From the first it was impressed upon every man
that he must learn to shoot, and to shoot straight.
The musketry courses began in the middle of
May, and so great was the number of men to
be trained, so limited the time and range
accommodation available, that rifle practice went on
continuously at Hythe from 5 a.m. until 7 p.m.  The
29th and the 31st Battalions carried out their
musketry training at Lyd, marching eighteen miles to
the ranges and camping on the flats for three weeks.
The men, needless to say, were as keen as mustard,
and their Regular instructors found them apt pupils.
A machine-gun school was set up.  Practice in
bayonet fighting and the ordinary processes of infantry
training went on simultaneously with musketry.  The
method of preparing new units to take their place
in the field is, however, much the same all the world
over, and by now only too familiar to millions of
the citizens of the British Empire.  It is the old
story of learning to do things under favourable
conditions so thoroughly and completely that in
moments of stress they are done almost sub-consciously,
leaving the mind free to grapple with anything
novel there may be in the situation or in the
actions of the enemy.  It was in this quality of rapid
decision in the face of unexpected emergencies that
the Canadian Contingent proved itself pre-eminent.
</p>

<p>
The Divisional Artillery was far behind the
rest of the formation as regards training.  Drafts
of artillery reached England as late as the middle
of August.  For some time practice was retarded by
lack of equipment, and even so late as October 10th,
when the infantry were becoming used to life in the
trenches, progress made by the artillery in England
was poor.  It stands to reason that far more time
and trouble are required to make an efficient gunner
than an efficient infantryman.  The <i>personnel</i> of the
Artillery brigades was, however, such as to inspire
high hopes, and these were fully justified by the 2nd
Divisional Artillery when it finally reached the
Front.
</p>

<p>
Ten weeks later the Inspector of Royal Horse
and Field Artillery inspected the training, and
congratulated Brigadier-General Morrison,
D.S.O. (who had returned after serving with great
distinction with the 1st Division in France), and
Major Constantine on the work accomplished.  "All
ranks," he reported, "know their work, the drill at
the guns is good and quiet, and good effects were
obtained.  I consider them the best Divisional
Artillery I have seen on Salisbury Plain this year."
</p>

<p>
A break was made in the daily task of training
the Division by two weeks' field manoeuvres in
August in the valley.  Here the Division operated
as a whole and existed entirely under Service conditions.
</p>

<p>
The 2nd Division had now gone through its
preliminary training both in Canada and Europe and
was ready for the ordeal of battle.  It has, however,
always been the habit of statesmen, leaders, and
commanders to address their troops in the field
before the hour of action comes.  The Great Causes
which inspire volunteer armies to supreme exertion
gain added strength from the presence of the leaders
themselves.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Aug. 4th, 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Prime Minister of the Dominion had visited
the troops at Shorncliffe in July, 1915 (Vol. I.,
page 165).  He was followed on August 4th by
the Rt. Hon. A. Bonar Law, M.P., Secretary for
the Colonies, who was accompanied by General Sir
Sam Hughes, K.C.B.
</p>

<p>
The presence of General Hughes was significant,
for he above anyone else was the embodiment of
Canada in arms.  He had performed the amazing
feat of raising a huge army in a country remote from
Europe to do battle for the Imperial cause.  When
one remembers that the presence of 7,000 men in
South Africa at the beginning of a century only
fifteen years old was regarded at the time as a
crowning achievement on the part of the Dominion; that the
enrolment of 40,000 men for the camp at Valcartier
and the dispatch of the First Contingent had been
considered only twelve months before this review as
a triumph of patriotism and organisation, who would
have ventured to predict that in September, 1915,
another contingent of equal strength would be about
to set sail for Flanders; that by the dawn of 1916
a 3rd Division would be in the trenches and
engaged in the death grapple of June; and that far
beyond this huge reserves would lie waiting in
Canada to create yet other divisions or replace the
fallen in the field?  Great Armadas had crossed the
Atlantic carrying armies beside which those
dispatched by the might of Great Britain against
Washington and his levies in a day when Chatham
still lived, dwindle into insignificance.  And the
tireless energy of Sir Sam Hughes directed the
system which procured the men to meet the demand.
Like all strong men he has, and has had, not
only friends, but opponents; but if these will
set aside the controversies of the present and
look down the vista of the future to an
impartial and final judgment, both alike will perceive
the singleness and simplicity of purpose which
constitute greatness of character, and, joined to strength
of will, lead to greatness of achievement.  As the
General looked on the march past of the 2nd
Division he might well have been thinking of the
pride of work well done; but in reality his heart
was with the men, who were going out to fight, suffer,
and perhaps to die for their common cause; and in
such thoughts there is no room for any pride except
that of the aim and the race.
</p>

<p>
The Colonial Secretary has a natural claim to
address a force of Imperial troops, but in this case
there are special reasons why Mr. Bonar Law should
have been given a cordial welcome.  He is Canadian
born and British trained, and therefore represents
a natural link of union between the Dominion and
the Mother Country.  Direct and business-like, at
once enthusiastic and unimpassioned, he is the
natural interpreter between the newer nations and
the old.
</p>

<p>
The conditions of the review were not happy.
A heavy thunderstorm had broken the summer
weather, and the troops were wet through long
before the inspection began.  The men, of course,
were not worried, and it struck more than one
observer that the driving rain and heavy
cloud-wrack behind it gave a solemnity to the occasion
which might have been lost in the mere picture of
green glades, tall immemorial trees, and brightly-dressed
spectators.  Rain, after all, has about it a
certain air of reality for anyone who is going to
Flanders.  As the artillery removed itself on its
own devices, the long columns of infantry, platoon
by platoon, began to swing past the saluting base,
where stood the Colonial Secretary and the Canadian
Minister.  The dull afternoon light shone on the
rippling bayonets, beneath which thousands of men,
superbly fit, marched by to prove to Canada and
the Empire that the New World was still ready
to redress the balance of the Old.  Something of
this seems to have stirred in the Colonial
Secretary's mind as he addressed the officers.  In simple
language he told his hearers that when he watched
them marching past he thought how strong had
been the call of duty which had brought them there.
The world knew what they had sacrificed, and that
every one of them was prepared to face danger
and death and to give a good account of himself
when the opportunity came.  He realised their
courage and their devotion, and he thought also,
when he saw so many young faces, that, after all,
their sacrifice was not perhaps so great as that
of those whom they had left behind in anxiety as
to the fate of their dearest.  He himself was born
in Canada&mdash;he was proud of what Canadian troops
had done and of the future which lay in front of
them.  "After the war things would never be quite
the same again."  Already by an arrangement with
the Mother Country and the self-governing
Dominions it was understood that when the time
came for peace, the Dominion Governments were
to have a say in the negotiations.  That marked
a great step onwards, but it was only a step.
It had long been his hope and was now his belief
that as a result of the war the time would come when
the whole of the self-governing Dominions, in
proportion to their population and resources, would
share with the Mother Country in the duty and
honour of governing the British Empire.

<p>
The 2nd Division had at least the sense that they
were contributing to the making of history.  Nor were
they without the further assurance that their efforts
were appreciated.  On September 2nd, 1915, his
Majesty the King, accompanied by Lord Kitchener,
inspected the Division before it left for the Front.
Once more, under a grey and gloomy sky, it
marched out&mdash;this time to parade before its
Sovereign.  The 2nd Division was only following
in the steps of the 1st, which had already received
that supreme honour.  But the 1st Division had
already earned the King's accolade in the field, and
there was a rigid determination on the part of the
2nd to do the same.  So, as line after line of
infantry went by the saluting point, the unspoken
homage was in the heart of every man: "One King,
One Country, One Empire."[<a id="chap01fn3text"></a><a href="#chap01fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Sept. 14th, 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Major-General Turner (Vol. I., p. 190) had taken
over the Division from General Steele, who had
been appointed to command the troops in the
Shorncliffe area.  Preparations were now begun for
departure.  The Divisional Supply Column had
already started on September 5th.  The real
crossing, however, began on September 13th, 1915, when
the transport, with the 4th Canadian Infantry
Brigade, the Borden Machine-Gun Battery,
the Divisional Signallers, the 4th Canadian
Field Ambulance, and all the motor ambulance
wagons of the Division, left Southampton for
Havre.  On the night of September 14th the
Headquarters Staff and the bulk of the Division
embarked, including the 4th Brigade, Canadian
Field Artillery.  The rest of the Divisional
Artillery, the 5th, 6th[<a id="chap01fn4text"></a><a href="#chap01fn4">4</a>] and 7th Brigades, were
left behind for a time to complete their training,
proceeding later to France on January 18th, 1916.
</p>

<p>
Eight battalions were left in reserve and absorbed
in the Training Division at Shorncliffe&mdash;the
23rd, 30th, 32nd, 36th, 39th, and 43rd, to supply
drafts for the Infantry, the 48th for the Pioneers,
and the Royal Canadian Regiment afterwards
incorporated in the 3rd Division.  The 2nd Canadian
Division Headquarters in Shorncliffe were then
closed.
</p>

<p>
The voyage of the 2nd Division was not to be a
long one like that of the 1st, from Bristol in the
West of England to St. Nazaire on the coast of
Brittany.  The high, white cliffs of Folkestone by
day and the light of its lamps by night are clearly
visible from the high downs above Boulogne in fair
weather; while the light of Gris Nez flashing like
a wheeling spearshaft has long been familiar to the
Canadian troops.  It was for Boulogne that the 2nd
Division set out&mdash;to the harbours below the heights
from which the statue of Napoleon on its great
bronze column still looks out, as he did all the
summer of 1805, at the white cliffs on which he was
never to set foot, to the coast, too, whence Cæsar
first saw the almost fabulous land of Britain.
Those conquerors of the modern and ancient worlds
would have marvelled had they beheld the sailing
of 20,000 men of French and British birth from
the other side of the Atlantic across the narrow
salt-water trench, once the confluent of the Thames
and Rhine, to defend the land of Gaul against that
Teuton menace which both of these had overthrown.
</p>

<p>
Who of the millions that have undergone the
experience will ever forget their first crossing
of the Channel in a troopship?  The absence of
any lights and the swift drive of the engines give
the sense of a stealthy escape from the unseen perils
of the deep.  Dimly visible for a moment is a dark
shape of another transport or some destroyer of the
escort.  The men who can crowd below are perhaps
asleep, but to the remainder, shivering a little on
deck in the sea breeze, the whole air and the
chopping seas seem to breathe something of danger, of
the mystery of the dark, and the romance of the
High Adventure yet ahead.  It was in this atmosphere
that a serious collision occurred.  The Staff of the
4th Brigade under Brigadier-General Lord Brooke
and the 10th Battalion were aboard a paddle-wheeled
steamer when a dark mass suddenly
shot out of the night and rammed her amidships.
The shock threw everybody off their feet; no
one could tell at first whether it was a German
cruiser or a friend; and had panic broken out among
the massed humanity of over a thousand souls on
board it would not have been surprising.  But the
Volunteer troops showed themselves in calmness
and discipline the equal of any Regulars.  The
instant the collision occurred the troops were paraded
on deck with the life-belts which had been provided
for them.  For a time it was thought that the ship
was going down.  But the men ranged on deck
remained steady in the ranks, and the parties told
off to loose the rafts carried out their duties swiftly
and surely.  The incident adjusted itself.  The
stranger, which turned out to be one of our own
destroyers, had by a fortunate chance struck the
great wooden paddle-box of the steamer, and though
the latter was for a time out of control, no irretrievable
damage had been done.  The transport carrying
the Divisional Staff stood by and endeavoured
to tow her in, but the hawsers and steel cables parted
under the strain of the rough weather.  It was
necessary to send for tugs from Boulogne, and,
finally, at five in the morning, that port was made.
All through the night an escort of destroyers which
had raced up at the first news of the accident circled
round flashing their searchlights over the seas to
guard against a possible submarine attack, but no
enemy appeared to disturb the work of rescue.  The
remaining ships of the Division, despite the heavy
weather, made the passage in security, and the whole
body began to pass up country to effect its junction
with its comrades of the 1st Division.
</p>

<p>
The landing in France possessed one feature
both of racial and historic importance.  The 1st
Division had included one company of the 14th
Battalion, which was entirely composed of French
Canadians, and many others of the same race were
scattered among the various units.  The 22nd
Battalion of the 2nd Division was entirely
recruited, as has been recorded, from the French
of the old province, and its appearance on the
sacred soil of France serves to awaken a host of
memories.
</p>

<p>
There is no parallel in history that matches the
picture of the descendants of the men who founded
Port Royal and Quebec under Champlain in the
first decade of the seventeenth century returning,
after three hundred years of absence and a hundred
and fifty years under a different flag, to fight once
more for the soil whence their ancestors sprang.
The German menace has welded the two great
nations of the West on the two sea-boards of the
Atlantic and linked the centuries together beyond
imagination and almost beyond belief.  In the firing
line at Ypres were found side by side not only the
successors of the British who had stayed in their
island home and of the French who had remained
in France and dealt with the British since on many
a hard-fought field in Europe, but the sons of those
who had struggled together before the entrenchments
of Ticonderoga or on the fateful Plains of
Abraham.  When after the Seven Years' War in
1763 the Empire of the West passed finally to Great
Britain under the pressure of British sea-power and
the military inspiration of Chatham, France must
have mourned what seemed the irrevocable loss of
her sons.  Yet in France and Flanders to-day they
are risen again for her service, returned across the
Atlantic by that same sea-power that once claimed
them, and are now warring on the very fields their
fathers held, with the same courage and fortitude
their race displayed in the eighteenth century against
Great Britain.
</p>

<p>
The French are of all people the most susceptible
to an appeal to the imagination.  One can
imagine their feelings when they learnt that a whole
regiment of French Canadians had landed with the
2nd Division.  Very strange must have been the
meeting between these two branches of a race
separated so long by the Seas of Time!
</p>

<p>
Gradually it dawned on these people that among
the strange soldiers from across the ocean were men
speaking their mother tongue&mdash;not the French,
perhaps, of modern Brittany and Normandy, but French
none the less.  One must picture the joyous effort
to find the common idiom and accent, the older
country casting back in memory across the years to
the point where the two streams of speech had
divided, the younger nation of the older speech
casting forward to catch the new French which had
sprung up since the division.  The scene is one for
the painter or the novelist, and this wonderful
journey's end in lovers meeting must leave an
ineffaceable imprint on the memories of both England
and France.  Dramatic moments are few in modern
war, but this was one of them&mdash;a fitting pendant to
that other scene when the joint memorial to Wolfe
and Montcalm was unveiled on the heights of Quebec.

<a id="chap01fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn1text">1</a>] The Divisional Artillery consisted of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th
Brigades of the Canadian Field Artillery, and the 97th, 98th, and
107th Siege Batteries.  The 4th Brigade was recruited in Toronto,
and commanded by Lieut.-Col. W. J. Brown, the 5th (Lieut.-Col. Dodds)
came from Winnipeg, the 6th (Lieut.-Col. King) was
raised from various quarters, and the 7th (Lieut.-Col. Stewart)
from Montreal, Toronto, and New Brunswick.  The Divisional
Ammunition Column was under the command of Lieut.-Col. Harrison.
The entire artillery of the 2nd Division was commanded
by Lieut.-Col. Thacker, until June 25th, 1915, when that officer
took command of the 1st Divisional Artillery and was succeeded
by Brig.-General E. W. B. Morrison.  Mention must also be
made of the other units of the Division.  The Divisional Engineers
were under Lieut.-Col. J. Houleston until September, 1915, when
Lieut.-Col. H. T. Hughes took over command; the Divisional
train was under Lieut.-Col. A. E. Massey, the Cyclist Company
under Lieut.-Col. Denison, and Nos. 4, 5, and 6 Field Ambulances
under Lieut.-Cols. Webster, Farmer, and Campbell respectively,
with Col. J. T. Fotheringham, C.M.G., as A.D.M.S.

[<a href="#chap01fn2text">2</a>] Major-General Steele's career in the army reads more like a
romance than reality.  Having distinguished himself as a mere
boy in all his examinations while attached to the British Regulars
then stationed in Canada, he left the Service, only to rejoin as
a ranker in the Red River Expedition of 1870.  Here he spent a
year in Fort Garry, which was then "the farthest West."  After
a short time in the Royal Canadian Artillery he went West
again, became a Major in the Alberta Field Force during the
rebellion of 1885, having raised his own corps of "Steele's
Scouts."  He was through all the fighting of that summer, and
finally broke up Big Bear's band at Loon Lake, a place in the
Great Northern Forest where no white man had ever before set
foot.  In 1898, as soon as the Klondyke gold rush began, he was
dispatched at once to secure the frontier, erect customs posts, and
prevent American miners establishing claims on the wrong side
of a vast and ill-defined frontier.  In 1899 he was promoted
Lieut.-Colonel, and became the military representative of the
Government in the Yukon.  The South African War brought him
immediately into the field.  Within the space of five days he
recruited "Strathcona's Horse" from the Western provinces;
within a month he had them ready to move from Ottawa&mdash;truly
a miraculous performance.  In South Africa he saw a good deal
of fighting in Natal and the Lydenberg district east of Pretoria,
notably at Belfast.  On August 26th, 1900, he was mentioned in
despatches, obtained the Queen's medal with four clasps, and
finally took command of a division of the new South African
Constabulary.  At this stage he was for six months under the
direct orders of Lord Kitchener, with whom he became intimately
acquainted.  In 1906, after a period of mixed civil and military
administration in South Africa, he returned to the Dominion to
take over the command of the Western Canada military district,
a post he occupied until December, 1914.  Seven thousand six
hundred men went from his command in the West to the First
Canadian Contingent, and before he left to take command of the
2nd Division no fewer than 24,000 men in his district had joined
the Colours.

<span class="sidenote">
<i>Sept., 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
With the junction between the two divisions the
work of the Canadian troops in Flanders enters on
a new and broader phase.  The meeting took place
in time midway between the tempest which raged on
the plains of Ypres in May of 1915 and that scarcely
less violent iron-storm which, in the same month of
1916, burst in the fields of St. Eloi.  An interval
of calm, or such calm as modern war knows, was
permitted for that reunion.  It is well for the
soldier that there should be such intervals, for the
strain of modern action, were it never relaxed, would
destroy the mind and nerve of man as surely as the
continuance of its shell fire must destroy the body.
But though modern armies cannot always be locked
in desperate conflict, the reader may not find the
ensuing chapters altogether dull.  He will be
able to trace the steps by which the original 1st
Division added unto itself first a second and then a
third, and developed into an army corps.  He can
watch the multiplication of the Staffs, the promotion
of Brigadiers to command divisions, of Colonels to
brigades, and of Majors and Captains to regiments;
the process of the division of labour as the
specialists develop in bombing, mining, or machine-gunning;
the foundations of schools of instruction
behind the line; the methodical study of the arts of
patrolling and raiding.  He can survey, in fact, the
full range of those methods by which large bodies
of men carrying rifles gradually develop into a
self-sufficient army far greater in numbers than the British
troops that the Duke of Wellington commanded, not
so far away, on the field of Waterloo.  As a stream
draws into it confluent after confluent until it attains
the dignity of a river, so the original Canadian
Expeditionary Force, by the flow of men across
the Atlantic, is becoming an army; and it is the
history of this process that the next few chapters
must relate.  In artillery alone is the development a
slow one, and here the 2nd and 3rd Divisions were
for long dependent on the assistance of the British
gunners.
</p>

<p>
The scene is laid in a sector to the south of Ypres
and to the north of Armentières.  Its more southerly
position in the line is marked by the greater number
of spinneys, small eminences, and commanding
heights, such as that of Kemmel, from which the
enemy's lines can be overlooked.  But portions
of it are a dead level, and it is very far from
the well-covered hills of the real southern line.
The main features are still those of Flanders&mdash;the
slightly rolling flat where the transparent
richness of the crops which spring from the
sand and the clay seems no deeper than the paint
of a fresco on the wall, and the scraggy trees and
ragged woods mock one with a delusive memory of
forest cool and shade.  As the army grows the
winter draws on, and the fine, hot autumn days and
brilliant nights with the moon high in the heavens
behind the trenches turn to the rains of November
and the mists and frosts of Christmas.  The ground
grows wet underfoot and the air is clammy and cold.
Such is the winter season of Northern Europe, when
most of the campaigners of history allowed their
troops to hibernate in warm and comfortable billets.
</p>

<p>
The 1st Division had spent the later summer on
a sector the right of which rests on the northern
edge of Ploegsteert.  As the 2nd Division came by
degrees into the fighting line the Canadian sector
was extended northwards until the left of the Corps
finally rested on a spot a little to the south of
St. Eloi.  The moves which resulted in the final
disposition were not all made in a day, but it would be
tedious to do more than note in passing the various
shifts the new corps made with the II British
Corps to the south of them and the V British Corps
to the north.  Roughly speaking, the northern line
ending by St. Eloi was taken over by the 2nd
Division while the 1st Division remained in the
Ploegsteert area to the south.  The dividing point was a
little to the north of Wulverghem, facing the German
trenches half-way between Messines and Wytschaete.
For the sake of clearness one might call
it the sector of Bailleul.
</p>

<p>
The distinguishing feature of the line is length
rather than depth&mdash;the precise converse of the
subsequent St. Eloi position.  The line from that place
to Ploegsteert is not excessive for a corps of three
divisions, but it is distinctly so for one with only
two.  In fact, on March 1st, when the whole three
divisions were assembled, the frontage was
occupied by six out of the nine brigades, and this six
brigade frontage was throughout the normal one.
But the 3rd Division was not in full existence till
the middle of January, 1916, and in the meantime
the reliefs could only be effected by such elements
of corps troops as happened from time to time to
be in readiness.  Thus on October 3rd, when an
additional two thousand yards were taken over,
and the 2nd Division occupied our final position
to the north, the only corps troops available for
reliefs were Brigadier-General Seely's force,
consisting of three regiments of the Cavalry Brigade
and the 1st Canadian Mounted Rifle Brigade.  The
42nd Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada) and
the 49th Battalion (Edmonton Regiment) did not
arrive till the middle of that month, the 2nd
Canadian Mounted Rifle Brigade till towards the end of
it, the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry
and the Royal Canadian Regiment till November,
and the various units which finally formed the 3rd
Division were not completed till January.  This
necessarily entailed a somewhat extended sojourn
in the front line area by the various brigades of the
first two divisions.
</p>

<p>
The task, therefore, of interchanging the different
units was one that required careful working out
on the part of the Corps Staff.  The ordinary
divisional front is held by two brigades, with a
third at rest well in the rear.  The business of
interchanging them becomes as mechanical as
that of a bridge-player opening a long and strong
suit; every unit knows to within two or three
days its time in the front line, support line, reserve
line, or rest billets.  As the units of the 3rd
Division began to arrive, matters, of course, became
simpler, but in the last months of the year the Corps
found itself compelled to make heavy calls on the
endurance of the various battalions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Sept. 14th, 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
To return to the narrative.  The 2nd Division
arrived at Caestre on September 14th.  On the
previous day the Canadian Corps had been formed.
Upon his appointment as Corps Commander,
General Alderson relinquished the command of the
1st Division to Major-General Currie, who was in
turn succeeded in the 2nd Brigade by Brigadier-General
Lipsett.  Major-General Turner was
already in command of the 2nd Division, and he was
succeeded in the command of the 3rd Brigade by
Brigadier-General Leckie.  The 16th Battalion was
taken over from Brigadier-General Leckie by his
brother, Major Leckie.  The changes in the Higher
Command were now for the moment complete.  The
duty of the 2nd Division was to relieve the 28th
British Division in what may be called for convenience
the Kemmel section of the line, which stretched
north from the ground of the 1st Canadian Division.
As in the case of all inexperienced troops, they were
given a "trial trip," and their officers went in with
the 84th and 85th British Brigades for a few days
to learn the tricks of the trade and the lie of the
land.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Sept. 23rd, 1915.</i>
</span>
The relief was finally accomplished by
September 23rd, 1915.  The 4th Brigade, 2nd
Division, took the north of the line; the 5th Brigade
the south; while the centre was stiffened by the
hardened veterans of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division.
The 6th Brigade remained in reserve at Kemmel.
</p>

<p>
The first experience of the 2nd Division and of
the new Canadian Corps was a curious one, as a
glance at the dates will suggest.  The last week of
September was the time of the great Anglo-French
offensive, which to us spells Loos and to our Allies
Champagne.  The advantage of the initiative is the
uncertainty for the enemy as to where the real
blow will fall.  Until he knows, he dare not shift
his reserves.  The ingenuity of the Canadian Force
was, therefore, exercised to produce without loss of
life the appearance of an attack which would pin
the Germans opposite to their ground and prevent
them from going to the assistance of their
sorely-pressed colleagues to the south.  The new corps
rose gallantly to the demand for theatrical effect,
and a demonstration was arranged along the
whole line, but particularly in front of the 1st
Division, opposite La Douve farm.  It must have been
exciting for everyone to think out methods of
simulating a bogus assault to keep the Germans on
tenterhooks.  On the night of the 24th the guns
opened on the enemy wire and cut great gaps thirty
yards wide in it as though to open the way for the
assaulting columns.  Dummy trenches were dug
close behind the firing line to hold the supports of
the supposed assailants.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Sept. 25th, 1915.</i>
</span>
In the early dawn of the
25th the Germans could see great and dangerous
activity in the Canadian trenches, which hummed
like a hive of bees about to swarm.  At 5.45 a.m. sacks
full of wet straw were fired and thrown on the
parapets whenever the wind blew towards the
enemy.  That same morning real gas was covering
in grim earnest the rush of the British over the
stricken field of Lens and to the Hohenzollern
Redoubt.  To intensify the effect, the platoon
commanders shouted orders and blew their whistles,
while scaling ladders and the shimmer of bayonets
were shown above the edge of the parapet.
Our troops then opened fire, both with rifles
and machine-guns.  The Germans, in the face
of this provocation and menace, became convinced
that an attack was imminent, though reflection might
have convinced them that serious assaults are seldom
so well advertised.  They put down a heavy barrage
behind our firing line to prevent the arrival of
supports, and thronged their own second-line trenches.
This was precisely the intention of the Canadian
Command, whose gunners shelled the communication
and support trenches severely.  About six
o'clock in the morning, when it was too late to
move troops to Loos, the false smoke thinned, and
the enemy could see clearly that no attack was in
progress.  The fire died away; but the German
bulletin announced the successful repulse of a
determined advance.  It is not surprising that the
Canadians have achieved a certain unpopularity
among their <i>vis-à-vis</i> in the trenches owing to
their predilection for "slickness."  Such incidents, as
the men know well, relieve the monotony of trench
warfare.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Sept. 26th to 30th, 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
From September 26th to 30th, following this
episode, certain changes were made in the British
line on the right of the Canadian Corps.  The 12th
Division was pulled out, to be sent further south,
and a new division, the 25th, was brought up to
take its place.  During the change the 3rd Brigade
took over a part of the British line and acted as
instructors to the inexperienced troops of the 75th
British Infantry Brigade for the space of a week,
when the scholars took over from the tutors.  Their
place in the 2nd Division was occupied by the 6th
Canadian Brigade, commanded by Brigadier-General
Ketchen, and until then in reserve at Kemmel.
</p>

<p>
All three brigades of the 2nd Division were
now in the front line, and, as has been mentioned,
they were extended two thousand yards to the
north to complete the final frontage of the corps.
They possessed in Divisional Reserve Brigadier-General
Seely's force, which had been replaced
in the firing line by the 2nd Infantry Brigade.
The line of the 1st Division was held by this
brigade and by the 1st Brigade, while the 3rd
enjoyed a well-earned rest as corps reserve.  These
two brigades were, however, holding the frontage of
three, and it must be observed once more that the
forces behind the entire British line were at this
period hardly sufficient to supply adequate reliefs,
much less to resist a strong attack.  This state of
affairs was merely the result of the general lack of
preparation of the British Empire for the duration
and scale of the land war.  In the first week of
October five brigades were in the front line of a
six-brigade frontage, and their total reserve was four
battalions of infantry and six regiments of cavalry.
During the month, however, the situation was
improved, since the 42nd (Royal Highlanders of
Canada), under Lieut.-Col. Cantlie, and the 49th
(Edmonton Regiment), under Lieut.-Col. Griesbach,
arrived on October 10th, and the 2nd Canadian
Mounted Rifle Brigade, under the command of
Colonel Sissons, on the 26th.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Oct. 5th, 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The beginning of October was not, however, by
any means without its incidents, both tragic and
glorious.  On the evening of October 5th, while the
great struggle round Loos was still raging, the 5th
Brigade was subjected to its first severe bombardment.
The perpetual pillars of yellow and green
smoke, slashed with black <i>débris</i> spouting to heaven,
and the earth-shaking roar of heavy shells, are
enough to try the nerve of the most trench-hardened
warriors, and this brigade was but a week
in the trenches and entirely new to the experience.
In these cases all depends on the example and
leading of the officers.  It may be recorded here how
that example was set.  Brigadier-General Watson
had been moving continually up and down in the
front of his brigade, and was passing through the
line of the 22nd (French Canadians).  He passed
Major Roy of that regiment in the muddy trench
and spoke a word to him.  Hardly had he turned
the traverse when out of the sky fell one of those
huge abominations fired from a trench mortar.
There it lay in a trench full of men, ready to
explode any second.  Like a flash Major Roy took
his risk and dashed to save the lives of the rest.
As he stooped to pick up the great greasy cone of
steel and hurl it over the parapet he slipped in the
mud, and the shell exploded in his arms.  There
died a very gallant gentleman, and with him all
doubts as to the steadiness of the French Canadian
regiment under shell fire.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the early part of October the enemy
exhibited great activity in mining on the front
of the Corps.  It was the turn of the New
Brunswickers to show their mettle in a first raid into "No
Man's Land."  The fibre of the race that province
breeds has become indurated by generations of
contest with the elements, and has taken on something
of the unbending hardness of the North.  They were
now to test these ingrained qualities against a new
antagonist, for immediately on their front the enemy
one day blew up a great mine.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Oct. 13th, 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The 26th (New Brunswick), under Lieut.-Col. McAvity,
was ordered to make a reconnaissance on
October 13th, and the company commanded by
Major Brown held the post of honour.  If the mine
crater could be occupied with advantage, then
it was to be held by the attacking party; if, on
the other hand, it was useless to hang on there,
the crater was to be abandoned.  Imagine the
infantry, bombers and bayonet men in four
successive lines, straining on the leash till the
artillery had finished pounding and the
smoke-bombs which had been prepared to cover the
advance from the sight of the German trenches
had been let loose.  Thrilling is the moment when
warriors climb their trenches to the assault.  The
New Brunswickers were untried.  But before dawn,
at four o'clock, out they came from a saphead dug
in advance of their trench, and raced for the crater
over forty yards of open ground.  The weight of a
threefold decision lay upon them.  Major Brown
and Lieutenant Fairweather, of the 26th, and
Lieutenant McPhee, of the Engineers, had to survey the
ground, determine whether to hold on or retire, and
guard against counter and flank attacks.  One party
at their order rushed to within throwing distance of
the German side of the crater, where the enemy
occupied a saphead from which noises of tapping
had been heard, and held off assault with bomb and
rifle.  Shielded by their efforts our officers examined
the ground, while Major Brown extended the
supports right and left of our saphead to ward off a
flank attack.  Both advanced support parties were
met by high-explosive bombs and a heavy
crossfire from enemy machine-guns.  In the words of
Captain McMillan, of the 26th:&mdash;"In the face of a
shower of bombs from the front, and enfiladed from
both sides by machine-gun fire, the first and second
lines went forward and gained the crater.  After a
careful reconnaissance made by the officers in charge
it was found inadvisable to remain in the crater, and
the order to retire was given.  Nor did that order
come a moment too soon.  Just as the officers and
party cleared the crater, a mine trap, whose
existence had been suspected, was fired by the Germans
and the whole force barely escaped destruction.  At
this moment the ground between the crater and our
trench was covered with a hail of bullets from the
machine-guns of the enemy, and by flying shells and
bursting bombs."  The explosion stunned everyone
within reach.  Sergeant Ryer, a well-known scout and
trapper in civil life, remained unshaken.  "Instead of
retiring at once, he kept in the open, using his rifle
as opportunity offered with good success, accounting&mdash;it
is believed&mdash;for eleven of the enemy."  After
he had helped to cover his comrades, with an
indifference to orders not unlike Nelson at
Copenhagen, Ryer turned to the wounded.  The losses of
the 26th had been severe.  Imagine a ground swept
by machine-gun fire "with a noise like a giant
tearing calico," the shattering crash of bombs, and the
perpetual spit-fire rattle from the enemy.  To live
in it seemed impossible.  But Sergeant Ryer, his
fancy shooting done, tried to give assistance to
Sergeant Cotter, who had led the first line to the
German sap.  Finding him beyond all aid, he turned to
Pte. D. Winchester, who was badly wounded,
unwound one of the wounded man's puttees, passed
it under Winchester's armpits and around his
own shoulders, and crawled back to the trench,
struggling under the weight of his comrade.
Pte. Daly came to his help, and between them they
dragged Winchester into safety.
</p>

<p>
For all kinds of patrol work between the lines
the Canadians showed an inherent aptitude from
the start.  The art of woodcraft, the inherited
instinct of men whose fathers and grandfathers had
been mighty hunters before the Lord, gave the
corps supremacy almost at once over their adversaries
in these contests of small groups in the dark.
</p>

<p>
Except for one brief period, when a particularly
adventurous Saxon corps developed a tendency to
dispute the mastery of "No Man's Land," the
Canadians throughout the winter of 1915 ranged
almost at will over that doubtful territory.  They
won the right by their conspicuous victories over
larger bodies of the enemy in struggles where good
shooting, steady nerves, and individual initiative
were more vital to success than drill or routine.
They excelled in the most fascinating of pursuits
which modern war has left to its votaries.  The
sharp night air, the rustle in the grass or the trees
which may mean an enemy, the stealthy crawl with
the fingers on the trigger, the fitful flare of the
star-shells, the rasp of barbed wire, the knowledge that
life depends on one's own personal swiftness of
action, wake again in civilised man the old instincts
of the hunter and the hunted.  Life runs keen in
the veins because Death lurks under every shadow.
In spite of their personal courage, the disciplined
stolidity of the Germans is hardly adapted to this
peculiar kind of sport.  They lacked the range of
inventiveness of their opponents, and by posing
opportunities of quick action they lost the initiative
of attack.  Instances without number could be given
of these small engagements on the front at night in
which every regiment has borne its share.  One
could almost select one's instances at random and
do no injustice to the general picture.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Oct. 20th, 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the night of October 20th, 1915, a patrol from
the 4th (Central Ontario) Battalion, in charge of
Sergt.-Major Matheson, became enveloped in a
heavy fog in "No Man's Land" and lost its way.
While trying to regain direction, Pte. Inwood
was wounded.  Corporal May went to Inwood's
assistance, and found him lying in the German
entanglements.  In attempting to remove Inwood from
the wire, the corporal's foot struck a tin can, and
the sound drew an instant volley of fire from the
enemy's parapet.  Inwood received another wound
in his body and May was hit in the thigh and
shoulder.  The corporal remained with Inwood in
the German wire until the latter's death, and then
crawled into the cover of a clump of bushes close
at hand.  In the meantime, the other members of
the patrol had been forced back to our trenches by
a converging fire from the enemy.  Sergt.-Major
Matheson, accompanied by Sergt. Norwood, went
out and searched unsuccessfully for the wounded
men.  At dawn the Sergeant-major went out again,
this time with Pte. Donoghue.  These two
separated soon after leaving our trench, the better
to cover the ground in their merciful quest.
Donoghue found Corporal May in the little clump
of bushes near the German wire, dressed his wounds,
and slowly, tenderly, and under the constant menace
of death, removed him to the head of one of our saps.
</p>

<p>
On the same evening Lieutenant Cosgrave, of
the Engineers, supported by a small party of the
15th (48th Highlanders), under Lieutenant
McLaurin, of the 16th (Canadian Scottish), who had
reconnoitred the ground beforehand, went out two
hundred yards from our trenches and blew up a
heavily-wired and fortified house.
</p>

<p>
The weather during the latter part of October was
inclined to be misty, and this led to a considerable
activity on the part of the patrols in front of the
line by night, and of the digging parties behind it
by day.

<p>
But a new horror was added to life&mdash;the discovery
of land-mines laid down by the Germans between
the lines, some fired by trip-wires after the fashion
of the spring gun in forbidden woods, others
electrically connected by wires with the hostile trenches.
On the 23rd, a whole party of the 8th (Winnipeg
Rifles) nearly fell victims to one of the former kind,
and Pte. Green, who actually touched off the wire,
was blown to atoms.
</p>

<p>
The end of the month was marked by one or two
very daring reconnaissances by Lieutenant Owen,
of the 7th (British Columbia) Battalion, up the
bed of the Douve River, and by a great aeroplane
battle.
</p>

<p>
The aeroplane battle occurred upon a morning
warm and bright with sunshine.  The conditions
were admirable for flying and observing, and, as
usual, a German Albatross took advantage of them.
Soaring high against the warm blue of the sky,
over Bailleul, over the headquarters of a division,
over our brigades and trenches and back again,
it glinted like silver in the morning sun.  The
snow-white blobs of bursting shrapnel from our
anti-aircraft guns followed its graceful sweeps and
curves&mdash;followed and followed, but never caught it
up; and thousands of our men stared after it.  But
a more dramatic spectacle was in store for the
watchers on the brown roads and in the brown
trenches.
</p>

<p>
A British machine appeared suddenly low against
the blue, mounting and flying out of the west.  The
men in the Albatross were evidently so intent on
their task of observing the landscape beneath them
and keeping well ahead of our blossoming shrapnel
that they failed to observe the approach of the
British 'plane as soon as they should have for their
own good.  They were heading west when they saw
their danger, and instantly the Albatross swerved
round and sped towards home.  But the British
flier had the heels of the German and the advantage
of the position.  It circled and dipped, and down
through the clear air aloft came the rippling
"tap-tap-tap" of the aerial machine-guns.  Again and
again the enemy's frantic efforts to escape were
frustrated by the skill and daring of the British pilot
and the hedging fire of the British guns.  Suddenly
the gun of the German 'plane jammed and ceased;
the pilot was hit and wounded; the Albatross
commenced a rapid descent, in which it was followed
by the British 'plane to within a thousand feet of
the ground.  Then, under heavy shell-fire from
German batteries, the victorious machine rose and
flew away undamaged, and the unfortunate Albatross
struck the earth between the front and support
trenches of the 14th (Montreal) Battalion and turned
turtle.  The German pilot was dead; the observer,
slightly wounded, crawled to our support trenches
and surrendered.  The German batteries kept up a
hot fire of high explosives and shrapnel on the
machine with the object of smashing it beyond hope
of repair before the Canadians could salvage it.
They made several direct hits, but our men sapped
out to the wreck and managed to bring most of it in,
piece by piece.  Among the articles brought in was
the machine-gun that had jammed in the heat of
the fight.  This was found to be a Colt gun.  Closer
examination proved it to be one of the original guns
of our 14th Battalion&mdash;to whose lines it had just
made such a dramatic return!  The gun had been
abandoned during one of the desperate and confused
fights of the Second Battle of Ypres half a year
before.

<i>Sept. and Oct.</i>, 1915.

</p>

<p>
In these months of September and October great
efforts were expended on improving the line.  Work
in the front positions was done by the occupying
battalions, and the troops in reserve came up night
after night to assist their labours and to create new
secondary positions and drive through fresh
communication trenches.  Even the training of new units
was occasionally and rightly sacrificed to the
performance of this essential task.  The weather was,
on the whole, favourable for these operations, with
the exception of three days of rain early in
September and a wet week late in October.  The 1st
Division, long on the ground and fortified by the
experience of what good trenches mean for comfort
and safety, was pre-eminent in these exertions, as
would be proved by the trench-map with its
continuous increase, month after month, in the black
and zigzag lines of new work.  Each tiny scrawl on
the surface of such a map represents the labours of
hundreds of men, extended over many nights.
Second and third lines grew apace, so that a sudden
attack of the enemy would still leave trenches to be
held and would reduce the German bite to mere
nibbles at the forward trench.  The communication
trenches are driven true and straight from well in the
rear, and up these the ration parties toil in safety night
after night under their burdens of food, water,
ammunition, and R.E. material to feed the front line.
These parties know well enough the difference
between well-made lines and bad ones.  Stooping
under the heavy weights as they struggle on through
the dark, they will bless in army fashion a smooth
and dry surface underfoot and a sound high parapet
which protects them from the casual German shells
which are searching for them, or the intermittent
whistle of the long-range bullet humming on its
errand in the dusk.  Messengers or stretcher-bearers
with their burdens can move backwards or forwards
even by day along the well-built hollow, and all
those who pass are protected both from the arrow that
flieth by night and the terror which walketh in the
noonday.  Very different is the story of a badly-kept
line.  It finds carrying parties struggling in, hours late,
exhausted by wading through mud and water, and
delayed by continually climbing out and walking outside
the trench to avoid impassable sections.  Here an
unlucky shell or a casual bullet may take its toll.
The men struggle back with difficulty, arriving
hardly before the dawn, and with their period of
supposed rest and recuperation turned into the most
arduous of labours.  It is not too much to say that
the efficiency of a regiment or division can be
tested by a comparison between the state in
which it takes over and that in which it leaves its
trenches.
</p>

<p>
The creation of secondary positions is as
important as that of communication trenches, and on
this task the Canadian Corps worked unsparingly
throughout the autumn.
</p>

<p>
The disposition of a brigade is two, or on
occasion three, battalions in the front line and one or
two in support or reserve trenches.  But in most
cases even the leading regiments will not have their
whole strength in the firing trench.  One or two
companies lie close up in support or reserve to
reinforce any threatened point.  The nearness of these
supports is a very present help in time of trouble,
and gives confidence to officers and men, who would
be nervous if they knew that no assistance was
nearer than a mile away in distance and an hour in
time.  But these lines must be dug under cover of
dark, so the men toiled with the spade through the
nights of autumn and blessed the dawn which put
a term to their labours.  Their record is written on
the scarred earth from St. Eloi down to Ploegsteert.
Let us hope that the corps which took their place in
March was duly grateful for the blessing of a
well-constructed line.

<i>Nov., 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
With the end of October and the beginning
November, however, trouble began.  The mists of
early autumn had enabled some of the back-line
digging to be done by day, without undue attention
from the German gunners, but with the rain of the
end of the first-named months the efforts of weeks
began to dissolve in hours.  As a sudden thunderstorm
fills all the ditches to the brink, so two days'
rain in the horrible clay of Flanders turns every
trench into a miniature mill-race.  Traverses,
parapets, and parados, which in the summer sun had
assumed the solidity of Egyptian monuments, collapsed
like melting jelly as the torrents tore under
the foundations.  Men struggled waist-high in
water to repair the damage, only to hear the heavy
splash of falling earth and sandbags as the rain
broke away the trenches as a cheese-scoop cuts out
cheese.  Many of the communications became
impassable, and parties had to walk outside them even
in broad daylight and in plain view of the enemy's
observers.  The situation of the Germans, at any
rate, was no better, and our gunners had their revenge
on them when they also were compelled to walk in
the open.  The last fortnight of November was,
however, fortunately drier, and the Canadian Corps were
able by increased exertions to make their trenches
safe and habitable for the winter.  The weak places
in the trenches were revetted with chicken-wire, and
strutted wooden paths two or three feet high, like
the crossings of a swollen stream, were placed in the
worst parts of the communication trenches, so that
even if men's feet were in water, they had a firm
foothold beneath them instead of a deadly morass.
In this work they were assisted by the 11th (British)
Labour Battalion, which was attached on November
1st to the Canadian Corps.  A scientific system of
drainage was devised and carried out.[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
One can cast one's eye southwards from Voormezeele
and St. Eloi through Vierstraat to Kemmel,
and from Kemmel and Petit Bois to Wulverghem,
Neuve Eglise to Hutte and Ploegsteert, and
everywhere line upon line of Canadian trenches score the
ground like a succession of gigantic furrows.  Far
beyond the line extends till it strikes the grey seas
of the Channel on the north and the snow-clad Alps
on the south.  The labour of these vast field-works
would have built the Canadian Pacific, and one may
wonder how long these gashes in the earth will
survive the passions and ideals of the men who created
them.  For some years after the war soldiers will
be able to move freely over the ground where once
the bravest man dared scarcely show his head, and
say, "Here we charged and here we stood our
ground"; or, "It was there the captain fell."  Then
the kindly work of Nature will crumble the well-built
trenches and cover them with grass, and the
industry of man will drive the plough once more
over the stricken fields of history, and Ypres and
St. Eloi will become as Valmy or Gravelotte.  None
the less, certain great earthworks or craters will
remain, and, like the hoof-prints "stamped deep
into the flint," will serve to remind the Canada of
the future that a line on the soil of Flanders is for
the nation holy ground.  These upheavals of the
raw earth, covered in time by the grass and turf of
centuries, may survive almost as long as the great
emplacements of the Bronze Age which, after four
thousand years, still guard the loop of the Thames
by Dorchester, command the valley under White
Horse Hill, and ring with a double forty-foot ditch
the immemorial Temple of Avebury.

<p>
The winter had now set in in grim earnest, as the
rains and mists of November bore witness.  The
nights were longer, and with them stretched out
hour after hour the possibility of activity denied to
the infantry of either side in the long summer days.
For great actions or extended movements the
sodden soil afforded no scope.  The sharp edges
of conflict are stationary&mdash;sunk in the muddy
trenches and nailed down to machine-gun
emplacements.  But while the fronts of the great war
machine are thus held, they are never still.  The
wear and tear of conflict go on day and night, week
after week, month after month.  Behind the infantry
in their earthy strongholds the great guns of the
artillery hide, long-sighted and tireless.  Some
30,000 shells a month pour out from their unseen
lips&mdash;nearly double the number given in exchange
by the Germans.  But, after all, gunnery is, in the
main, an affair of daylight; the dark has given birth
to the adventure of the midnight escalade.  "One
form of midnight activity," says Sir Douglas Haig,
in his report of events from December 19th to May
19th, 1916, "deserves special mention, namely, the
raids or cutting-out parties which are made at least
twice or three times a week against the enemy's
line.  They consist of a brief attack with some
special object on a section of the opposing trenches,
usually carried out at night by a small body of men.
The character of these operations&mdash;the preparation
of a road through our own and the enemy's wire,
the crossing of the open ground unseen, the
penetration of the enemy's trenches, the hand-to-hand
fighting in the darkness and the uncertainty as to
the strength of the opposing force&mdash;give peculiar
scope to the gallantry, dash, and quickness of
decision of the troops engaged, and much skill and
daring are frequently displayed."  The
Commander-in-Chief adds that the initiative has, on the
whole, been with the British, and that statement
would certainly be true of the Canadian section of
the line.  The objects of such expeditions might
roughly be described as threefold:&mdash;To gain
prisoners and information; to lower your opponents'
moral&mdash;a form of terrorism; and to kill as many
Germans as possible before beating a retreat.  Two
features of the attempts of this character undertaken
by the Canadian Corps will at once arrest attention;
the immense pains taken to rehearse the actual
performance beforehand and the lavish and successful
use of bombs as a weapon of offence.
</p>

<p>
The grenade, indeed, seemed to have passed into
history with the fortress warfare of which it was the
product.  It has always required for its effective use
an enemy tethered to his ground and impervious from
his cover to rifle fire.  In open fighting the rifle must
always have the mastery of any hand-thrown weapon
because of its superior range.  Now the importance of
fortifications or fixed defences has always depended
on the nature of the weapons employed by man.
The original dyke, moat, or vallum, from the Stone
Age to the Fall of Rome and the rise of the Middle
Ages, gave the defender the advantage both of cover
against arrow or javelin, and of the psychological
moment for the counter-attack, sword or spear in
hand, as the advancing force floundered in confusion
against a sudden obstacle.  It was used as the Duke
of Wellington used the ridge of Busaco and many
other crests of the Peninsula to inflict the maximum
loss on the assailant, and to keep reserves well in
hand for a counter-stroke, the power and place of
which could not be foreseen by the enemy.  It
possessed, of course, the disadvantage of all field
works of a non-continuous nature: it might be
outflanked and surrounded.  It was to guard against
this danger that Imperial Rome in the second
century constructed a permanent line of works, wherever
Nature failed in her protection, from the mouths of
the Rhine to the mouths of the Danube, and from
Carlisle to Newcastle, and thus produced the only
parallel to the gigantic trenches which bestride
Europe to-day.  The defence of such a system
implied, of course, a great Central Power; and as that
Power sank into impotence, the fortress keep of
stone, impervious to anything but treachery or
starvation, arose in its place to protect the local
potentate against his neighbour.  But these great
structures again vanished into smoke before the
blasting force of gunpowder.  Earthworks were
the next answer of the defence to the new attack,
but these in their turn failed because no country
had the population, the wealth, or the will to
keep an adequate garrison on the whole of a
threatened frontier, while an army superior in the
field could outflank the defender or compel him to
give battle in the open.  The musket and the field
gun became, therefore, the supreme arbiters of war,
and sieges a mere incident in their struggles.
Napoleon simply carried the process to its logical
conclusion.  But the advance of science brought new
developments in its train.  First, it gave weapons
so terrible that men could hardly live against them
in the open field, and the advantage was to the
prepared defence.  This in itself would have mattered
little, for Metz would have fallen in 1870 by
starvation though it had been as strong in
guns as the Russian fortress of Port Arthur.
But science also gave populations great enough
to hold with a continuous garrison, as did the
Roman Empire, the whole line of national frontiers.
With this the inherent weakness of the field work,
its liability to outflanking, vanishes; and we come
back once more to fortress warfare, and with it to the
grenade.  In all sieges the grenade is there, from
the seventeenth century to Badajos, Sevastopol, and
Port Arthur.  The opposing trenches are impervious
to rifle fire, but not to the lobbing of high explosives
thrown in a curve from anything up to forty yards.
Neither side was quite prepared for this development,
and the original jam-tin bomb with a protruding
fuse lit by a match was indeed a sorry device
begot of native ingenuity and urgent need, and was
soon improved upon.  The 1st Canadian Division
showed their adaptability by taking very readily to
the new weapon.  The Guards acted as their
instructors, and the Canadian Corps set the pace at
once by being the only troops that attached to each
brigade a bombing-school of its own.
</p>

<p>
The result of this earnest preparation was seen
in the success of the bombing assaults in the
encounters of the winter of 1915-16.  Perhaps more
admirable, because more rare, was the careful
rehearsal of each assault given to the units behind the
lines.  The photographs taken by the aeroplanes and
the results of dangerous personal reconnaissances
were used in this service, until an accurate model of
the enemy's trenches could be dug and each man
could go through the precise task he would have to
perform at the actual moment of crisis.  Rarely were
these ground plans found to be wrong.  But the
Staff which could conceive and carry out such a
laborious undertaking deserves to be given the
kind of praise which history has bestowed on the
Headquarters Staff of the great Von Moltke.  They
had grasped the true principle underlying all success
in war.  You must practise and practise the expected
together and disseminate all available knowledge
through all ranks, so that when the unexpected
comes, as it must in battle, every man knows the
situation and the probable conduct of his neighbours,
and can act on his own initiative without
throwing the whole plan into irremediable confusion.
</p>

<p>
The doctrine, at any rate, was justified by its
results.  Early in November the Officer Commanding
the 2nd Infantry Brigade (Brigadier-General
Lipsett) decided that conditions on his front were
ripe for the proving of his belief that strong parties
of determined troops, properly equipped and led
and operating on carefully-planned lines, could
enter the German trenches and inflict casualties out
of all proportion to their own losses, make prisoners,
and get away.  These objects were fully realised.
At this time "No Man's Land" on the whole Canadian
front was well in our control, and so completely
so in the area through which the River Douve
meanders from the German position before Douve
Farm to a point at which it cuts our trenches just
north of Red Lodge, that German patrols seldom
ventured beyond their wire entanglements.  The
Scouts from the 5th Battalion, commanded by
Lieut.-Col. G. S. Tuxford, reported a gap in
the wire before the point of their intended
attack twenty yards in width and leading to
the hostile parapet.  The scouts of the 7th,
however, found that a screen of trees protected the
defences before the point selected by their battalion
for entry into the German trench.  The Commanding
Officer of the 7th (Lieut.-Col. V. W. Odlum)
then decided that such wire-cutting as was required
for his share in the raid should be done by hand.
</p>

<p>
The night closed in chilly with a promise of
rain.  The moon was frequently obscured by clouds.
Lieut. W. D. Holmes, Sergeants Merston and
Ashby (7th Battalion), and Corporals Odlum and
Babcock crept out and were busy with the enemy's
wire by nine o'clock.  They worked on this job until
midnight, lying flat when the moon was clear, and
cutting fast when it was clouded.  As the task was
one which caused both muscular and nervous
fatigue, hot cocoa was carried out to the wire-cutters
at intervals during those three hours.  During that
time two lanes were cut completely through the
German entanglements.  They ran diagonally so as
not to be observed from the German parapet, and
converged on the point of attack.  Satisfied with his
work in the wire, Lieut. Holmes then took up his
bridging party and spanned the River Douve in
three places.  One bridge was laid at a point
within sixteen yards of the German parapet.
Sergeant Ashby and Lance-Corporal Weir were
conspicuous in this enterprise.
</p>

<p>
The raiders from both battalions were to enter
the German trench at 2.30 a.m., but the attacks were
entirely separate as to their striking points and their
control.
</p>

<p>
The 5th Battalion party, under Lieuts. J. E. Purslow
and K. L. T. Campbell, was checked directly
beneath the German parapet by an obstacle which
had been overlooked by their reconnoitring party.
That obstacle was a trench or ditch about 12 feet
wide and 6 feet deep, full of water from the
overflow of the Douve.  In the water, rising from the
bottom of the ditch to within a couple of feet of the
muddy surface, were coils and tangles and strands
of barbed wire.  Five men of the party fell into
this ditch and were with difficulty rescued.  The
officers made several attempts to negotiate it, only
to learn that it could not be crossed either by
swimming or wading.  As further investigations failed
to disclose a passage across the wired and flooded
ditch, the party bombed across it into the heavily-manned
trench.  This grenade fire, delivered at a
considerable distance from the 7th Battalion's point
of attack, doubtless served well in misleading the
enemy as to the extent and exact location of the
threat against his front.  Also, it must have caused
him numerous casualties.
</p>

<p>
Their supply of grenades exhausted, the 5th
Battalion party returned to their own line.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, the British Columbians
(7th Battalion) had left our front-line trench
by way of a gap in our parapet in front
of Irish Farm.  Led by scouts along the
Douve, they crossed the bridges, passed the lanes
through the enemy wire, and scaled the hostile
parapet, and commenced operations.
</p>

<p>
Capt. C. T. Costigan, grenade instructor for the
brigade, led one party of thirteen men, and
Lieut. McIllree led another.  These parties were composed
of bayonet-men, grenadiers, grenade-carriers,
wire-men, and shovel-men.  Every man wore a black
mask, and none carried any badge or mark of
identification.  Each bayonet-man had a small
electric lamp fastened to his bayonet in such a way that
he could flash it without shifting his grip on the
rifle.
</p>

<p>
Lieut. A. H. Wrightson followed with the rifle
party and telephone.  His command consisted of
five riflemen, a telephonist, a linesman, and two
stretcher-bearers.
</p>

<p>
Before the raiders reached the German wire a
sudden heavy downpour of rain commenced.
Under the black screen and splashing patter of the
storm our men went over the enemy parapet.
Capt. Costigan and Lieut. McIllree dropped into
the trench together&mdash;on top of a German sentry
crouched beneath a sheet of corrugated iron, seeking
shelter from the rain.  McIllree shot the sentry,
seized another German, disarmed him and threw
him down, then clubbed yet another of the enemy
with the German rifle.  He was then overtaken by
his men, and they all moved down the trench to
the right, bombing, bayoneting, and shooting as they
went.  In the meantime, Capt. Costigan&mdash;a medium-sized
officer of the most charming manners&mdash;had
dispatched three of the enemy with his revolver and
bombed his way along the trench to the left for a
distance of three bays before being joined by his
party.
</p>

<p>
The trench was heavily garrisoned, and (as we
afterwards learned from the prisoners) the men had
been warned by their officers to expect an attack,
but all the forewarning had not forearmed them
sufficiently for their salvation.
</p>

<p>
For twenty minutes the Canadians toiled terribly
in the outraged stronghold of the enemy, by the
light of star-shells from the German support
trenches, under a tumult of fire from artillery and
machine-guns in both lines and the crashing of
their own bombs.  The dug-outs were full.  While
our raiders made prisoners of the occupants of some
dug-outs by dragging them bodily forth, and dead
men of others by simply throwing grenades in at
the narrow doorways, our artillery made a barrage
in the rear of the invaded trench and our machine-guns
searched with their fire all the roads by which
German reinforcements would be likely to move.
Lieut. Wrightson, with his rifle party, remained at
the point of entry into the German trench during
the bombing.  He communicated the progress of the
affair by telephone to the Commanding Officer of
the 7th Battalion, and the officer in charge of
operations (Capt. L. J. Thomas) guarded against a
German counter-attack from the rear and passed
prisoners over the parapet to our scouts.  The scouts
took the prisoners as they came over the parapet to
our bridge-covering parties; these in turn passed
them back to a strong party which supported one of
our listening posts, and from the listening post they
were handed back to and through the gap in our
front line.
</p>

<p>
When the allotted time of twenty minutes was up,
Lieut. Wrightson gave the signal for the bombing
parties to get out and come back.
</p>

<p>
As soon as our men were clear of the enemy's
parapet our artillery dropped its fire from the
German communicating roads and rear positions to the
bombed trench, in the hope of catching the
reinforcements which the enemy was sure to have got
up by this time at all costs to repulse the invasion.
It is probable that our gunners' hope was realised.
</p>

<p>
The return of the raiders across "No Man's
Land" was safely accomplished.  Captors and
captives retired immediately from our front-line trench
by the rising and waning illumination of star-shells
shooting up hysterically from the enemy's bewildered
positions.  They moved back to safety under
a brisk fire of a variety of weapons.
</p>

<p>
But this condition of being "under fire" is nothing
to write about so long as one happens to be far
enough under it.
</p>

<p>
Lieuts. Holmes and Wrightson, with their scouts
and riflemen, did not come in until they had
withdrawn all our bridges from the Douve.
</p>

<p>
The artillery and machine-guns put the finishing
touches on the offensive operation.  At about four
in the morning every British and Canadian gun cut
loose again and drubbed the German positions for
twenty minutes.  Machine-guns spat from every grey
bush behind Irish Farm.  The woods about Red
Lodge and all the hedges on the Ploegsteert Road
were red and alive with flashes of field-guns and
howitzers.  From Romarin way several big naval
guns joined in the game.
</p>

<p>
Thus the enterprise at La Petite Douve was
accomplished without a hitch.  A handful of men of
the 7th Canadian Battalion had gone into the
German trench, killed at least fifty of the enemy, and
brought away twelve prisoners.  They had knocked
parapets, dug-outs, and machine-gun emplacements
about.  The artillery had knocked things about, too,
in their part of the enterprise, and who knows the
extent of the casualties caused by our high explosives,
our shrapnel, and the fire of our machine-guns?
</p>

<p>
The moral of the enemy had been shaken
and his nerves unstrung.  Fame and decorations
had been won, and fresh glory for Canadian arms;
a new branch of the science of trench warfare had
been demonstrated and proved; and against all
this one Canadian soldier had given his life and
another a little of his blood.
</p>

<p>
The next episode begins with a series of failures
and ends with a striking success.  A large tree felled
across the Messines-Armentières road by artillery
fire, at a point within one hundred and twenty yards
of our front line, had been gradually built into a
formidable barricade by the enemy.  Several
attempts by our artillery to demolish this strong point
failed, owing to an obstructive screen of large trees
along the roadside.  This barricade grew in strength
daily.  Strong wire entanglements were put across
its face and across the ditches on its flanks, which
ran parallel to the road from our position to the front
line of the enemy.  The garrison moved in and out
by way of the roadside ditches.
</p>

<p>
Several gallant attacks were made on this position
before it was finally taken and demolished.  In an
unsuccessful attack led by Lieuts. N. W. F. Rant
and A. V. Evans, of the 2nd Canadian Mounted
Rifles, Lieut. Rant was wounded by the explosion
of a German grenade.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Dec. 8th, 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
A week later, on the night of December 8th, after
a careful reconnaissance by daylight, Lieut. John
Galt, Jr., of Lord Strathcona's Horse, and fourteen
grenadiers and riflemen of his regiment, assaulted
the barricade.  The enemy held the position in force,
and his fire was too heavy for the Strathconas.  Our
party was driven in, and Lieut. Galt and two of his
men were left wounded on the ground.  Of the
twelve who got back to our lines, eight were
wounded.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Dec. 14th, 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the night of December 14th-15th, the 5th
Battalion and the 3rd Battery Canadian Field
Artillery took the barricade in hand.  Preliminary work
was done by our artillery on the 12th, 13th, and 14th.
During the bombardment of the position on the
13th, twenty Germans broke from the cover of the
barricade and made a dash across the open for their
own lines.  Sergeant McGlashan, of the 5th Battalion,
a crack shot and an opportunist, dropped
five of the enemy before they could reach their
parapet.
</p>

<p>
The 5th Battalion had constructed an emplacement
for a field gun in our front line where our
trench cuts the Messines-Armentières road.  From
a flank of the emplacement they sapped out towards
the barricade.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Dec. 15th, 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Early on the morning of the 15th an 18-pounder
from the 3rd Battery Canadian Field Artillery was
brought down the road by an armoured car to
within a couple of hundred yards of the prepared
emplacement.  From that point it was man-handled
into position in our trench by Capt. G. V. Taylor
and his gun crew.  Attacking parties from the 5th,
commanded by Lieuts. K. T. Campbell and
K. A. Mahaffy, and supports under Lieut. E. H. Latter,
took up position to right and left of the gun and
just outside the parapet.
</p>

<p>
It was now four o'clock in the morning.  On the
minute our artillery opened against the German
trenches with shrapnel and high explosive, and
Capt. Taylor's gun cut loose at the barricade, point
blank at 120 yards, firing five rounds a minute for
five minutes.  Then our guns in the rear lifted their
fire from the enemy's front line to his reserve
trenches, and the attacking parties of grenadiers and
riflemen advanced to the site of the barricade.  Four
dead and two living Germans were found in the
ruins of wire and sandbags.  The living were
captured and sent back to our trench.  Live wires were
discovered in the bottom of a ditch on a flank and
immediately in rear of the position.  These were cut
in a hurry, in the belief that one or more of them
connected mine locations near at hand with the
hostile trench.  Our men then mined the ruined
barrier and retired to one of our saps.  The German
artillery and machine-guns now became active, and
retaliated heavily against the wrecked barricade and
our front line and winter trenches.
</p>

<p>
During the examination of the prisoners it was
learned that three wounded Canadians&mdash;one of them
an officer&mdash;had been passed back through Messines
a few days before.  It was suggested more in a
reliance upon hope than upon fact that those
men may have been Lieut. Galt and the survivors
from the attack of December 18th, when Lieut. Galt
and two men were left behind.  All we know
is that his name appeared in the list of
"Missing"&mdash;a word which means a greater tragedy than
any other in the casualty list.  The dead have died
in their glory, and of them we know the best and
the worst; the wounded we expect and hope to see
again; but the missing remain for months nothing
but a supreme and torturing anxiety.[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Jan. 30th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the night of January 30th-31st, 1916, two
battalions of the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade
(Brigadier-General Ketchen), supported by artillery,
machine-guns, and trench mortars, succeeded
in an important attack against the unsuspecting
enemy on their brigade front.  The objects of this
operation were the same as those of the 7th
Battalion's offensive in November, to obtain prisoners
and information, to cause casualties, apprehension,
and material damage.  This enterprise exceeded
that of our 2nd Brigade in that it pierced the German
line at two widely separated points.
</p>

<p>
In their conception and plans of attack the
General Officer Commanding the 6th Brigade and
his Staff gave the same careful attention to details
as had their comrades of the 2nd Brigade two
months before.
</p>

<p>
The 28th (North-West) Battalion's objective was
a point on the northern side, and that of the 29th
(Vancouver) Battalion a point on the southern face
of the Spanbroekmolen salient.  Here, a little to the
south-east of Kemmel and about the centre of the
Canadian line, the German line runs sharply in to a
western thrust over some 1,900 yards, and the attacks
were like the jaws of pincers gripping the base of
the protuberance at that distance from each other.
The two objectives were about eleven hundred yards
apart.  The wire in front of these selected points
was cut solely by hand, as one of the chief features
of this attack was to dispense with the customary
artillery preparation and so take the enemy by
complete surprise.
</p>

<p>
The operation, as has been stated, consisted of
two widely separated and individual attacks,
delivered simultaneously, both maintained in the
hostile trenches for the same number of minutes and
simultaneously withdrawn.  Scout-Sergeant Turner
and Corporal Conlin, of the 28th Battalion, worked
in the enemy's wire from 10 p.m. to 1.45 in the
morning, and stayed there until joined by the
attacking party, with whom they entered the German
trench at about twenty minutes to three.  The
enemy's entanglements had been strongly reinforced
during the previous day, under cover of a heavy
fog; but Turner and Conlin stuck to their difficult
and dangerous task and completed it without an
error.
</p>

<p>
The raiders of both battalions advanced from
their positions of readiness in "No Man's Land"
at half-past two sharp.  The 28th Battalion party,
thirty strong, commanded by Capts. D. E. MacIntyre
and K. C. Taylor, lost a few minutes in negotiating
the trunk of a fallen tree, and were still strung
out in the German wire when sounds of exploding
grenades and an increased flaring of star-shells told
them that their comrades of the 29th were already
in violent touch with the enemy.  There was no
time to lose.  Lives hang on fractions of seconds in
such work as this.  The two captains and the two
tireless wire-cutters were still in the lead.  Together
they crawled up the sloping face of the big German
parapet, and each threw a grenade into the crowded
trench.  Four explosions followed.  Sentries shouted
and fired their rifles.  Capt. MacIntyre accounted
for one of the sentries with the second shot of his
automatic.  Then the four leaders jumped down
into the 10-foot-deep trench, into the midst of
confusion and rage and fear.  The other raiders
followed them with a rush.
</p>

<p>
Here were thirty Canadians with blackened faces[<a id="chap03fn2text"></a><a href="#chap03fn2">2</a>]
and armed with sudden death in a trench full of
Germans.  Many of the Germans were "standing
to," many had but then scrambled from their
dug-outs, their blankets still about them, and their feet
still unbooted.  Make the picture for yourself, with
the help of these extracts from Capt. Macintyre's
report:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The trench seemed full of men running both
ways....  Almost at once Corporal Conlin fell at
my feet shot through the head.  Behind Conlin was
a Hun.  I shot him through the stomach.  The noise
was frightful, and I could not tell where it was
coming from.  The flares made it nearly as light
as day.  I was knocked down by something once,
but don't know what it was.
</p>

<p>
"After six minutes I blew the horn, and all the
men heard it and the squads retired to the point of
entry.  Capt. Taylor held the right and Sergeant
Cameron the left.  I asked them if all their squads
were out, and they said 'Yes.'  Then I told them
to 'beat it,' and we all jumped."
</p>

<p>
The casualties suffered by this party were two
men killed and two officers and eight men wounded.
Capt. Taylor, though wounded in the leg while in
the very act of invading the trench, did terrible
execution.  It is claimed for him that he killed
fourteen of the enemy, shooting some and bayoneting
others.  He was wounded in eight places, but
returned to our lines unaided when the affair
was over.
</p>

<p>
The majority of our casualties were caused by a
machine-gun which enfiladed the invaded trench.
This gun was fortunately put out of action by a
bomb from our trench-mortars just before the retirement
commenced.  The 28th Battalion party brought
out no prisoners, but inflicted thirty-nine casualties
by actual count.
</p>

<p>
While the North-Westerners were thus engaged
at Peckham, the raiders of the 29th Battalion were
as busily employed in their chosen place of trench
at Spanbroekmolen.  The officers in charge of the
Vancouver Battalion's assault were Lieuts. G. I. Gwynn,
N. E. O'Brien, and L. A. Wilmot.  Lieut. Wilmot
and his men cut the wire, then acted as
guides to the others, and accompanied them into
the trench.  The leading men of the right and left
parties went over the parapet together, using the
loophole of a machine-gun emplacement as a step.
Sergeant Dungan bayoneted the first two sentries
encountered by the left party.  Lieut. O'Brien
entered a dug-out and captured one of its inmates.
A machine-gun opened fire on the raiders, but the
gunner was promptly shot by Lieuts. Wilmot and
O'Brien and the gun and the dug-out of the crew
were bombed.  Other dug-outs were also bombed.
The right party, on the other flank of the central
machine-gun emplacement, did equally fine
execution.  The work of Lieut. Gwynn was conspicuous.
</p>

<p>
Things had gone very well with the raiders thus
far, when Lieut. Wilmot was wounded by a grenade.
In spite of his injury he kept his head clear and a
grip on the situation.  Seeing that a number of
prisoners had been taken and that the alarm of the
enemy had become general, he ordered a retirement,
and then signalled to our artillery to open fire.  The
return to our lines was accomplished without
accident.
</p>

<p>
The 29th Battalion killed at least twenty of the
enemy, did considerable damage to dug-outs and
machine-guns, and brought back three prisoners.
Lieut. Wilmot, Sergeant Kirkland, and two men
were wounded.
</p>

<p>
These two successful raids illustrate not
inaptly the various phases through which advance
patrol work has gone.  The first stage, as soon as
trench warfare set in, was the casual encounters of
hostile parties in the dark.  The second was the
organised trench raid by night, in which the
Canadians led the way.  The last stage was reached in
midsummer, before the Canadians fought on the
Somme, when the 19th Ontario Battalion made a
most successful daylight rush into the enemy
trenches, led by Lieuts. B. O. Hooper and
S. S. Burnham.  They disposed of forty or fifty of the
enemy, and after remaining in the enemy's lines
for five minutes returned with very valuable
information as to the enemy's dispositions.  And
these, as I have said, are instances, chosen
almost at a venture, to show in what manner and
under what conditions we go raiding in "No Man's Land."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap03fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap03fn1text">1</a>] Lieut. John Galt was taken prisoner,
but died of his wounds
very soon afterwards.  He was buried by the enemy, and the
words "Here lies a British Officer" inscribed on his tomb.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap03fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap03fn2text">2</a>] The one thing most likely to be seen by the flare-lights sent
up by the enemy is the face of an opponent.  Those advancing in
"No Man's Land," therefore, blacken their faces to avoid being
seen.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Dec., 1915.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The main event of the New Year was the formation
of the 3rd Division.  Authority to create this
force had been received in the last week of
December, and at the same time the 7th and 8th
Brigades had come into being.  The 7th Brigade,
which was commanded by Brigadier-General
MacDonell (who handed over the command of Lord
Strathcona's Horse, R.C., to Lieut.-Col. C. M. Nelles,
C.M.G.) consisted of the Princess Patricia's
Light Infantry (Lieut.-Col. C. H. Buller), the Royal
Canadian Regiment (Lieut.-Col. C. H. Hill, D.S.O.),
the 42nd Royal Highlanders of Canada
(Lieut.-Col. G. S. Cantlie), and the 49th (Edmonton) Canadian
Battalion (Lieut.-Col. W. A. Griesbach), all of which
had been acting for some time as corps troops.
The 8th Brigade was made up of the six Canadian
Mounted Rifle regiments, which had up till now
been part of Seely's force.  They were made into
four battalions of infantry, known as the 1st
(Lieut.-Col. A. E. Shaw), 2nd (Lieut.-Col. C. L. Bott), 4th
(Lieut.-Col. S. F. Smith), and 5th (Lieut.-Col. G. H. Baker)
Canadian Mounted Rifles, and placed
under the command of Brigadier-General Williams.
Early in January the 3rd Division was constituted
out of these two brigades, and Major-General
Mercer was appointed to the command.  Coming
events cast no shadows before, and there was no
fore-knowledge of the ill-luck which was to attend
one of the distinguished officers, and the death in
action which awaited the other.  All seemed fair for
the prospects of the 3rd Division, which was within
a few months to pass through the most terrible ordeal
that the Canadians had yet sustained.  The creation
of this new force scattered Brigadier-General
Seely's command.[<a id="chap04fn1text"></a><a href="#chap04fn1">1</a>]  The Canadian Mounted Rifles,
as we have seen, were incorporated in the 3rd
Division, while the Cavalry Brigade was removed
altogether from the Corps Command.  The 2nd
King Edward's Horse was dispatched on January
14th to General Headquarters, and the remaining
units, the Royal Canadian Dragoons, Strathcona's
Horse, and the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery,
were attached on January 26th to the 1st Indian
Cavalry Division at Friville.[<a id="chap04fn2text"></a><a href="#chap04fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
General Seely commanded a Brigade holding the
front trench line since May of 1915, and it was
unfortunate that the fact of his commanding a
Cavalry Brigade compelled him to abandon the
advanced command on the redistribution of the
cavalry units.  In the opinion of the Higher
Command and of all Canadian officers who came in
contact with him, he exhibited conspicuous intelligence,
coolness, and courage in a degree which
qualified him for high command and a distinguished
military career.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Jan 7th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
By the end of the first week in January the
7th Brigade was able to begin its share of trench
duties, and took over from the 1st Brigade of the
1st Division.  Their first turn of duty as a Brigade
was a long one, lasting for full three weeks.
The month was, on the whole, a quiet one until the
trench raid of January 30th/31st, described in the
previous chapter.  The weather turned from wet to
fine and cold, and the most persistent reminders of
winter were the occasional fogs, which settled down
like white blankets on the flats and enabled parties
to move about with impunity in the day-time.
</p>

<p>
The artillery bombardment on both sides formed
the main feature of the month.  Although the corps
was not able to keep up the great superiority over
the Germans in the number of shells fired in
November and December, very heavy bombardment of the
trenches in front of Messines took place.  The
enemy, perhaps in reply, shelled the front trenches
somewhat severely.  On the whole, however, their
bombardments were characterised by the usual
features&mdash;a wide dispersement of shells over a large
area, Dranoutre being heavily bombarded during
the early part of the month.  This kind of attack
is annoying rather than serious.  The policy of
the Canadian gunners was very different.  It was
to concentrate on objects of real importance.
Organised bombardments of sections of the
enemy's front were carried out by the artillery,
and the combination of the heavy batteries and
field guns was most effective.  German mounds
and fortified positions near the front lines were
battered in, and all machine-gun emplacements were
carefully registered in case of sudden emergencies.
It is the custom of the enemy to occupy farm
buildings as redoubts, and two direct hits were
obtained by the gunners at La Douve Farm
on January 7th.  Germans were seen scattering as
the result of these shots, and were instantly pursued
by shrapnel.  It is necessary to lay some stress
on the work of the artillery, which is liable
to suffer neglect; only the infantry can know
the relief of hearing the guns roaring over their
heads.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Jan. 16th and 17th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Throughout the month of January considerable
liveliness in patrol work was kept up, and if
encounters between parties were infrequent, this fact
was due to Teutonic caution.  Some encounters,
however, did take place, and there was fighting on
the 16th and 17th on the front of the 3rd Infantry
Brigade.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Jan. 22nd and 23rd, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the night of the 22nd and 23rd the 8th
Battalion (Winnipeg Rifles) made a careful
reconnaissance of their front&mdash;a task in which Privates
Bole, Gunn, and Matkin, scouts of the regiment,
particularly distinguished themselves in a short,
severe encounter with the enemy.  Here again the
lack of automatic pistols and sufficient ammunition
proved a handicap in the struggle.
</p>

<p>
The incidents in which good work was done
are almost too numerous to mention, but a
particular interest attaches to the death of
Lieut. Owen, of the 7th British Columbia Regiment, well
known as a daring explorer in "No Man's
Land."  Lieut. Owen and three of his men encountered
some fifteen Germans in the sudden and nerve-breaking
way which characterises a patrol battle.  A
fierce fight with revolvers and bombs ensued, and
four Germans at least were seen to fall; then the
bombs ran out, and a retreat became imperative.
The officer ordered the men to retire, saying, "I am
coming right after you," and remained, covering
the retreat by revolver fire.  He never returned, and
when his party went back to seek him they found
him lying in the wet ground with a bullet through
his head.
</p>

<p>
The end of the month, which passed in comparative
quiet until the assault of the night of the 30th,
described in the previous chapter, was chiefly
marked by the arrival of two distinguished
visitors.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Jan. 28th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On January 28th H.R.H. the Prince of Wales
spent a day with the Canadian Corps, surveying the
whole field from the eminences behind the lines and
passing down a portion of the front trenches.  He
met and conversed with the various Brigadiers and
a few of the Regimental Commanders.  On the
30th, Mr. Bonar Law, Secretary of State for the
Colonies, whose interest in the corps is well known,
arrived, and addressed the 31st (Alberta) Battalion.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Feb., 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
In February began that period of close co-operation
with the V British Corps which was destined
to last for nearly seven weeks owing to the
persistent fighting at the Bluff and about the Mound
of St. Eloi.  So long is the range of modern
artillery that the guns of neighbouring corps and
divisions can be of the greatest assistance to the
actual combatants by firing slantwise into the enemy
positions around the field of action, while an infantry
demonstration may hold up his reserves.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Feb. 13th, 1916.</i>
</span>
About
three o'clock in the afternoon of February 13th a
terrific bombardment was directed against the British
trenches north of the Bluff, a high artificial mound
covered with trees immediately north of the
Ypres-Comines Canal; a series of mines was exploded
in the neighbourhood of Hill 60 and in the
direction of Hooge and of Sanctuary Wood.  As
the dusk fell several assaults were delivered
along the line defended subsequently by the
Canadians on the day of June 2nd.  The majority
of these assaults were repelled, but the Germans
broke through the Bluff north of the canal, and
succeeded in establishing themselves in the British
front trenches, where they stayed until they were
expelled on March 2nd.  This action was the
beginning of many woes to both combatants.  The
moment the trouble started the V (British)
Corps called up the Canadians and asked for
the help of their guns.  This was readily accorded,
and throughout the evening of the 13th and the
day of the 14th a combined Anglo-Canadian
shoot was directed with success on the German
positions in front of the Bluff.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Feb. 16th, 1916.</i>
</span>
Further relief to the
British was afforded by an extension of our line on
the night of February 16th, 700 yards to the north,
as to set free the Northumberland Fusiliers.
This task was given to the 6th Brigade, and brought
it into the trenches which flanked the line on the
right of the St. Eloi position, and from which the
final relief of the Northumberlands was made in
the battle of the first week of April.  The 29th
(Vancouver, "Tobin's Tigers"), supported by the
28th (North-West), took over this additional task.
</p>

<p>
Patrol fighting went on steadily all this time.
Early in the month of February a particularly
exciting action was fought between a large party of
the 10th (Western Canada) Battalion and an equally
numerous party of Germans.  It had been decided
to creep up, cut the German barbed wire, and bomb
their front-line trenches.  Lieut. Kent and Sergeant
Milne, of the 10th, with two privates, succeeded in
cutting the wire, and were joined by a column of
fifty men.  While waiting immediately in front of
the German trench for the best opportunity of
bombing the enemy positions, a patrol of thirty
or forty Germans stumbled across them from
the flank.  A fierce medley in the dark followed,
the Germans attacking with bombs and revolvers,
and our men with grenades, bayonets, and
knobkerries.[<a id="chap04fn3text"></a><a href="#chap04fn3">3</a>]  The enemy machine-guns took the alarm
and fired blindly into the scrimmage.  Eventually
the German patrol was dispersed with heavy casualties,
and the 10th returned with five prisoners.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Feb. 23rd, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The 17th was an unfortunate day for the Canadian
Corps.  Brigadier-Generals MacDonell and Leckie
were both hit by stray bullets and seriously wounded
during their tour of the trenches.[<a id="chap04fn4text"></a><a href="#chap04fn4">4</a>]  On the 23rd, the
9th Brigade of the 3rd Division was formed.  It
consisted of the 43rd Canadian Battalion, under
Lieut.-Col. R. McD. Thomson; 52nd, under
Lieut.-Col. A. W. Hay; 58th, under Lieut.-Col. H. A. Genet;
and 60th, under Lieut.-Col. F. A. de
L. Gascoigne, and was placed under the command of
Brigadier-General F. W. Hill, D.S.O.  The 3rd
Division had now its three brigades; and with a
sharp brush between the 42nd (Royal Highlanders
of Canada) Battalion and some over-adventurous
Germans, the month came to a close.
</p>

<p>
The Canadian Corps was now approaching the
second crisis in the history of its various divisions;
this was to lead them through three months of
continuous fighting steadily northwards across the
blood-stained fields of St. Eloi and Hooge until
they almost reached the scene of the Second Battle
of Ypres.  To grasp the inner meaning of these
movements and the consequences to which they led, it is
essential to take a wider survey of the strategic
position which the Allied Commanders had to face
on the Western front.  Two great bodies of the
German reserves were known to be in existence, the
first opposite Verdun, the second in the region of
the northern British line.  Whether this last
concentration was a defensive measure against a
possible British advance, or portended a third German
assault on the Ypres salient, could not in the month
of March be known for certain.  One fact at least
was clear.  The persistent and violent offensive
against Verdun which marked that month made it
incumbent on the British armies to come to the
assistance of the French.  This was done in two
ways.  A fourth army was assembled out of the
growing hosts in France, and the Arras sector of
the line given into its charge&mdash;a step which
released a French army for the heroic contest before
Verdun&mdash;while a series of attacks was delivered
from the original British line, any of which might
have been the beginning of an assault on a larger
scale.  The actions of the Bluff, of the Mound of
St. Eloi, and of Vimy, were designed to show the
enemy that in the northern line we were "ware and
waking," and to pin the enemy reserves to the
ground.  Nor, it may be added, were the Germans
slow to take up the challenge.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Mar. 2nd, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the whole series of actions with which the
remainder of this volume is concerned began with
the German assault on February 12th on the Bluff,
when the troops of the V British Corps, who held
the line on the left of the Canadians, were driven
from the position on the Bluff and the front-line
trenches to the north.  Preparations had been
made for the recapture of the lost positions, and the
advance took place on March 2nd.  The Divisional
Artillery of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions[<a id="chap04fn5text"></a><a href="#chap04fn5">5</a>]
co-operated that day with the gunners of the V British
Corps in a terrific bombardment of the ground to
be taken.  As a result of this fire a large section of
the German front-line trenches and communication
trenches north of the canal was reduced to ruins,
and the successful assault of the British on the
morning of March 2nd met with little resistance.
The lost ground was regained and consolidated.
This action was one of the first to demonstrate the
increased blasting force of massed artillery, which
became the standard weapon of offence on either
side during the battles of the next five months.
The continued piling up of munitions and guns
during the preceding twelve months had begun to
modify profoundly the tactics of the Western front,
and it would be alike an error and an injustice to
judge the performance of the infantry in the spring
of 1916 by the standards of the previous year.
The old British idea of a solid and immovable front
line held almost entirely by the fire of a rifleman
to a yard of trench, was beginning to give way in
the stress of circumstances and the example of the
French.
</p>

<p>
A line more lightly held by the aid of machine-guns
and wire entanglements, and a greater disposition
to yield or gain ground, were the signs of a
new era.  But chiefly the enemy's guns were our
teachers, for their iron lips pronounced very
conclusive arguments.
</p>

<p>
However, if the main work of the Canadians in
the attack on the Bluff lay with the Canadian
gunners, the infantry were by no means idle.  They
assisted the V Corps by a demonstration on their
front, and by massing three battalions of the 4th
Infantry Brigade behind their left flank to come
to the aid of the British in the event of a
counter-attack.  All arms contributed to the frontal
demonstration.  In the early morning of March 2nd
smoke-bombs were loosed from the trenches as though in
prelude to an attack, and a great blare of musketry
and machine-gun fire roared up and down the line.
The Germans sprang to arms and hurried
supports up their communication trenches into their
lightly-held front line.  It was for this that our
field guns had been waiting, and with continued
bursts of fire they ranged the denser masses opposite
as they came crowding into the trenches.  The
retaliation of the German artillery was singularly
ineffective, probably because their attention
was now wholly occupied with the line further north.
This operation produced one striking incident of
ingenuity in warfare.  At one point in the corps
position the stream of the Douve, flowing rapidly
with the winter rains, ran through our trenches and
disappeared into the German line.  This fact
suggested to Capt. Costigan, D.S.O., of the 10th
Battalion, a new method of alarming the Hun.
</p>

<p>
This enterprising officer suggested that a raft
loaded with high explosive might be floated down
the current and exploded in the enemy's lines.
</p>

<p>
The stream was, however, narrow, and, as anyone
who has thrown sticks into a river will remember,
the tendency of a floating object is to get stuck on
some obstacle or corner on the way down.
Capt. Costigan therefore proposed to accompany the raft
himself until it was within certain reach of the
objective.  He and Corporal Witney came out of
the trenches and carried the raft to the river.
After floating down some distance, he found the
stream continually obstructed by low overhanging
boughs, and to avoid any chance of failure he
continued to pilot his dangerous convoy to within
thirty yards of where the German barbed wire,
stretched across the channel, barred any further
progress.  Here he waited in the water until the light
of a flare gave the signal for the general demonstration.
The fuse was then lit and the load shot fair
at the enemy's obstruction from a distance of thirty
yards.  The explosion was a very fine one, and so
perturbed the gentle soul of the enemy that he fired
off several concealed machine-guns, the existence of
which the 10th Battalion had long suspected but
the location of which they had never known.
Writing in cold blood, it is easy to represent such a feat
of arms as ordinary, but when one considers what
the action really entailed, the exploit was heroic
even as we count heroism to-day.  It was
something which an ordinary man could not have done
and could not reasonably have been expected
to do.  The long stumble in the dark with sudden
death in one's hands, the plunge into the icy stream,
the physical struggle with the sweeping boughs and
jutting bends, the swift drift down towards the
enemy, and the calm waiting in the cold, dark water
for the given signal, serve to show that the most
romantic deeds of the hero of fiction can be matched
and mastered in the battlefields of to-day.
</p>

<p>
That the whole demonstration was a success is
witnessed by the following telegram from the V
Corps:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
"SINCERE THANKS FOR YOUR MOST VALUABLE
CO-OPERATION.  SHOULD ENEMY RENEW
COUNTER-ATTACK TO-MORROW AT DAWN OR
LATER, HOPE YOU WILL AGAIN HELP US."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Mar., 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Early in March orders were issued by the 2nd
Army Commander for the exchange of fronts
between the V and the Canadian Corps.  The
sector held by the V Corps runs from the Ypres-Roulers
Railway just north of Hooge down south as
far as St. Eloi.  It constituted the southern half of
the Ypres salient, and was by common consent about
the worst portion of the whole British line.  In the
autumn of 1914 during the first battle of Ypres, it
had been heroically defended by the Guards
Brigade, the Household Cavalry, and the 7th
Division, seldom mustering more than 5,000 men at any
given time, against the successive attacks of two
German Army Corps and of the Prussian Guard
lasting for a month.
</p>

<p>
The V Corps had now held it for little short of a
year, and had during that period incurred heavy
losses.  Nor is this to be wondered at when one
considers the number of general and minor actions
which had taken place in the area since the great
attack on Hill 60 in April, 1915.  The trenches
round Hooge had continually changed hands.
Fierce divisional actions had been fought there
on June 16th, July 30th, and August 8th, 1915;
while later in the autumn an unsuccessful British
assault had been launched against the Bellewarde
Lake line.  Of minor actions there had
been no end, while the great bulge of the salient
rendered every trench in it liable to that most
deadly of dangers, a direct lateral fire from heavy
guns placed to the south or to the north.
Salients are valuable as examples of the British
soldier's willingness to die rather than to live.
They make a great many widows and orphans and
splendid material for patriotic speeches.  For the
rest, their utility may be questioned&mdash;and has been.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Mar., 1916.</i>

</p>

<p>
The transfer of a sector from one Army Corps to
another is one of those operations which the layman
thinks of as done by a single sweeping stroke of the
Commander-in-Chief's pen.  In reality, it is a slow
and intricate process&mdash;nothing less than the gradual
interchange of all the population of two countrysides
and all the means of feeding and clothing them&mdash;a
wave of immigration and emigration affecting more
than 120,000 people, and this has to be carried out
with the minimum of disturbance, since the
inhabitants of the two areas must be ready to man the
trenches and fight a battle at any stage in the process
of change.
</p>

<p>
The Staffs are in the position of two householders
who are exchanging residences and moving their
families under the immediate threat of a burglary at
either or both houses.  If it is done on too large a
scale, there will be confusion, but, on the other hand,
every day that the move is protracted, there will be
mixed Staffs and units in the same battle line and
sector&mdash;a state of affairs not conducive to the
efficient management of a sudden crisis.  Far behind
the front line trenches the ramifications of the
services extend; for though a brigade may be holding a
frontage of a couple of thousand yards, its section
runs back through miles of land crowded with
reserves, with light and heavy artillery, with transport
services, hospitals and depots, and all the paraphernalia
of modern war.  The trench line is like a tooth,
the depth of the roots of which is only discovered
when one tries to pull it out.  To the Staffs, at any
rate, the period of movement is one of strain and
anxiety, and the total changes were not completed
under a period of three weeks, during which time
both corps were engaged in heavy and continuous
fighting.
</p>

<p>
The battle of St. Eloi was indeed a joint or rather
a successive affair carried on by units of two Corps,
the Canadians and the V (British).
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Mar. 17th-April 8th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The moves began as early as March 17th, when
the heavy divisional artillery, supporting the 3rd
Canadian Division, were taken north, and were
completed by the night of April 8th.  The Corps
Command of the two sections was not handed
over till April 4th.  A glance at the map will show
the problem which confronted the Corps Commanders.
The V Corps held exactly the southern
curve of the Ypres salient from almost due east of
the town.
</p>

<p>
The left of its 24th Division rested on Bellewarde
Beek, and its line continued along the rise through
Sanctuary Wood to a high point south-east of the
extremity of Zillebeke Lake, known as Mount
Sorrel.  We shall have occasion later to study
this ground with more particularity, for the force
which holds it holds Ypres in the hollow of
its hand.  Here the salient headed back violently,
running almost due east and west, took a southerly
turn again, crossed the railway to Comines, passed
Hill 60 of glorious and tragic memory, and struck
the Ypres-Comines Canal by the Bluff.  This was
the sector of the 50th British Division&mdash;south again
was the 3rd British Division holding what was
destined to be the field of St. Eloi from the canal to
Bois Quarante.
</p>

<p>
At the village of St. Eloi there was another of these
violent turns of the line which leave the opposing
forces facing each other due north and south.  The
total length of this corps sector was about six miles,
but the curves of the trenches and the ground would
make the actual number of yards to be held
considerably greater.  It was, roughly, broken up into
three sections of two miles each belonging to a single
division.  With Bois Quarante the salient of Ypres
came to an end.  The Canadian Corps line to the
south reaching to Ploegsteert has already been
described.  It was devoid in the main of salients and
had become increasingly peaceful since the fierce
fighting in the streets of Comines and Wytschaete
in the autumn of 1914.
</p>

<p>
It was held, when the 3rd Canadian Division was
formed finally in the middle of February, by three
divisions on a frontage of six brigades.  The 3rd
Division had no line of its own, but sent its brigades
up indifferently to relieve those of the other two
divisions.  It was therefore selected as the first of the
infantry formations for transference to the new
Canadian front.
</p>

<p>
A moment's consideration will make it clear that
to exchange two bodies of men in the front line
would mean an open gap in the defence during the
period of the full relief.  As in the game of "Fox
and Geese," though the metaphor is perhaps not
very complimentary to the enemy or ourselves, a
single hole in the ranks lets the fox through.  The
change can therefore only be made in two ways.  It
can be begun by moving the reserve troops of the
two corps into each other's positions and pushing
them up into the front line in succession until the
process is complete, or by a swifter and more direct
method of marching the reserve division of one
corps to relieve a front line division of the other,
this division in turn becoming a temporary reserve
for its neighbouring corps.  In accordance with the
former plan, the 3rd Canadian Division was taken up
in the third week of March and took over from the
24th Division in the Hooge-Zillebeke sector, while
the 24th Division came back to the rest area of the
Canadian Corps, whence they in turn displaced a
front line Canadian Division.  The process once set
on foot by the initial move becomes more or less
automatic.  But it is necessarily slow.  It would be
in the last degree inadvisable and dangerous to
substitute larger bodies of troops in a single night and
place each on ground with which it is thoroughly
unfamiliar.  Even the ordinary visits of officers to
their new trenches a day or so in advance would be
no protection against confusion in the dark on
ground unknown to a whole brigade or division&mdash;and
this lesson was written in letters of blood in the
first week of April over the stricken field of St. Eloi.
The 3rd Division move was therefore made by
degrees.  It began on March 18th with two
battalions of the 8th Brigade to the V Corps camp
behind the lines, while two British battalions took
their place in Canadian reserve.  The next day the
exchange of the remainder of the Brigade was
effected, while in the course of the night the two
original Canadian battalions took over their share
of the British trenches.  On the day of the 20th
the entire 7th Canadian Brigade marched from its
own reserve area into that of the V Corps near
Poperinghe, and went into the firing line the
following night.  The 9th Brigade followed them on the
23rd, and became the supporting brigade of the
whole division.  The relief of the north section of
the line was now complete, and the divisions
changed on the night of the 21st.  In the meantime as
each British unit was pulled out it came swiftly and
surely into the place of the Canadians.  The change
can be put most simply in a mathematical form.  If
<i>A</i> represents the British in the trenches, <i>B</i> the
British in reserve, <i>C</i> the Canadians in the trenches,
and <i>D</i> the Canadians in reserve&mdash;<i>B</i> and <i>D</i> change
places.  That is the first move.  On the following
day or night approximately <i>D</i> relieves <i>A</i>, and <i>B</i>
relieves <i>C</i> in the trenches.  That is the second move.
There remains only the substitution between the two
units <i>C</i> and <i>A</i> and the full relief has been
accomplished, and each party stands complete within its
new area.  The process in a corps will be slow, since
the unit of exchange will be only two battalions out
of thirty-six, or at most of a brigade.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Mar. 23rd-25th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Thus the 24th British Division as soon as the 3rd
Canadians had got into place, began to relieve the
1st Canadian Division.  On the night of the 23rd
two of their battalions took the lines of the two
battalions of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade
in the trenches, and the change was finished by the
night of the 25th.  Next came the turn of the 1st
Canadian Brigade, which was out by March 28th-29th.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Mar. 28th-29th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On that night the 50th British Division began to
move to the rear as the leading columns of the 1st
Canadian Division came up to take its place.  The
process was continued until the 2nd Canadian
Division in its turn stood in the trenches of the 3rd
British Division.  The length of time and the order
of the moves are best indicated by the days in which
the various high commands took over their new
responsibilities.  The 3rd Canadian Division took over
from the 24th British Division, as has already been
mentioned, on March 21st.  The 24th British
Division from the 1st Canadian Division on March
30th, giving ten days for the double change.  The
1st Canadian Divisional Staff assumed responsibility
for the area of the 50th Division on the night of
April 3rd, four days later.  The 50th relieved
the 2nd Canadian Division on the same night, while
the 2nd Canadian Division did not relieve the 3rd
British till the fatal night of April 4th-5th.  Reading
the map from north to south, we find the 9th and 7th
Brigades holding the front of the 3rd Canadian
Division; the 3rd and 1st Brigades in the same order
as that of the 1st Division, while the 6th Brigade
covered the whole frontage of the 2nd Division
opposite St. Eloi.  The Corps Commanders changed
their functions on April 4th, and by the 7th-8th the
V Corps were safely ensconced in the Canadian area.
</p>

<p>
But in describing this move in its completeness
we have run ahead of history.  While the columns
of weary men were tramping through the dust of
the day, the delicious cool of the evening, and the
chilliness of the night march, and the great batteries
were being slowly removed from position to position,
an event had occurred which added greatly to the
difficulty.  If the transfer of a corps can be done in
peace so much the better for all concerned.  In this
case a fierce conflict was raging on the front of the
3rd British Division before the 2nd Canadian
Division had taken over from them.  After the fighting
at the Bluff in February and March, it had been
determined that the V Corps should assault the
enemy's position at St. Eloi, and this attack had no
doubt originally been intended to be the business
of the corps concerned.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Mar. 27th, 1916.</i>
</span>
For other reasons, which
it is not necessary to relate here, the Canadians were
brought up half-way through the intended action,
which began on March 27th.  The strategic reasons
for a move on the British front in answer to Verdun
have been indicated; the tactical reasons for a
change in the <i>personnel</i> of the line were strong.
</p>

<p>
None the less, the obvious disadvantage of
changing the higher command in the middle of an action
would have been overwhelming but for one single
reason.  The mineshaft and the mines, the explosion
of which would hurl the charge, were by the end of
March ready for use.  Every hour's delay meant a
risk of their discovery and a counter-explosion by the
enemy, when the labours of weeks would have been
lost for ever.  In these difficult and conflicting
circumstances it was decided by the higher authorities
to send the 3rd British Division to the attack
opposite St. Eloi, and to bring the Canadian 2nd Division
up to their support and relief as soon as the first
stage of the fighting was over.
</p>

<p>
On the night of March 27th the mines were exploded,
with cataclysmic effect, and six huge craters
full of dead or wounded Germans took the place of
the enemy's front trenches.  The Northumberlands
and the Royal Fusiliers of a British Division were
over the parapet in a moment and dashed on the
shattered enemy position.  A heavy barrage of
artillery fire was kept up by the various divisional
artillery brigades to prevent the counter-attack; in
this the Canadians took their share, as the
Commander of the V Corps telegraphed in the
following message:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
"The handling of the trench mortars
reflected the greatest credit on the officers
and men concerned."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the meantime, the 4th Canadian Brigade had
been giving most valuable assistance in linking up
the right of the attacking regiments with the old
line.  They had driven a communication trench
during the four days of doubtful fighting through
from the trenches on the right of the St. Eloi
position to the new line&mdash;and it was christened
forthwith "The Canadian Trench."  Further
demonstrations were made by our infantry up and
down their front and were duly and generously
acknowledged as before by our brothers-in-arms of
the V Corps.  "Thank you very much for all the
most valuable help you are giving.  Your assistance
has contributed very largely to the success which we
have achieved."  But the attack of the Northumberlands,
though it had attained its immediate objective,
had not been uniformly successful.  It had begun to
encounter all those difficulties which were to confront
the 6th Canadian Brigade.  The centre attack went
right through the crumbled <i>débris</i> of the craters, and
a position was established some two hundred yards
south of them and four hundred yards in advance
of the old British line.  The 3rd Division fought
throughout with the greatest gallantry and resolution.
On the right, the efforts of the 4th Canadian
Brigade succeeded finally in establishing touch,
but the left remained in the air, and Crater 5, the
easternmost of the big craters, was still in the
enemy's hands.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 2nd, 1916.</i>
</span>
Finally, after four days' fighting,
it was necessary to make what was practically
a renewed assault on April 2nd and clear the
enemy out of the debatable area.  This was done
with the utmost gallantry by the 3rd British Division
and a new line well beyond the craters finally
established.  But this last effort absolutely exhausted the
energy of the troops concerned.  They had fought
like heroes, but there are limits to human endurance,
and it was imperative to bring up the Canadians to
their support.  A considerable number of German
prisoners passed through the lines of the Canadian
troops in support, and the reports speak of them as
fine upstanding men in the main, but too young from
our military point of view.  The Divisional
Command was able to extract from them much valuable
information as to the distribution of the German
regiments.  There can be no doubt that the enemy
infantry fought well at St. Eloi, and with a nerve
and initiative that they have seldom displayed.
They may have been new troops, but they were not
old men driven on by their officers to certain death
in massed formation, and they were all the more
formidable for that.
</p>

<p>
It was now necessary to move the 2nd Division
into action.  The 6th Brigade led, and the 27th and
31st Battalions were its spearhead, with the 28th
and 29th in support and reserve.  The Northumberlands
had been in the new line for about forty-eight
hours, but they had been unable to place it in a good
condition for defence.  Their trenches were the
remains of German second or third line defences
choked with the dead and wounded of both
combatants; their communications were only to left and
right; firing trenches or platforms there were
practically none; the earth was a sodden pulp and the
skies full of falling shells; the schemes for the
reconstruction of the lines put forward by their divisional
command, wise as they were, had not been carried out
owing to extreme weariness and the want of material;
the position of the enemy was unknown, and doubt
and darkness enveloped the whole situation.  It was
under this cloud of danger and uncertainty that the
6th Canadian Brigade advanced to the relief.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 3rd, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the night of April 3rd began the most serious
engagement in which Canadian troops had been
involved since the Second Battle of Ypres.  The 2nd
Division was ordered to occupy the ground won by
the 3rd British Division in the two successive actions
on March 27th and April 2nd.  To understand the
protracted battle which ensued it is necessary to
have a clear grasp of the ground over which it was
fought.  The opposing lines opposite St. Eloi ran
almost due east and west, instead of the north and
south frontage which marked the usual direction of
Allied and German trenches.  The old German line
had been a salient north pushed out towards St. Eloi
and receding from it right and left.  The new line
captured by the 3rd British Division was a salient
thrust due south into the German position and
receding again slightly on its right and abruptly on
its left, to meet the old British line.  In other words,
the old British line had been the arc of a bow turned
north and the new line became the arc of a bow
pushed south.  The distance between these bows
never exceeded 500 yards, and both of them were
less than 1,000 yards in length from end to end, with
a direct frontage of 600 yards.  In the middle,
running as the string of both concave bows and
separated by 200 or 250 yards from either old or new
line, was the original German line blown to atoms in
most places and represented throughout the centre
part of its length by a series of four huge
minecraters.  These crowned the mound of St. Eloi, a
rise in the ground which dominated the surrounding
country.
</p>

<p>
To hold the craters and the mound was to look
down into your enemies' trenches.  The explosion of
the great mine had leapt to heaven in a colossal
shower of yellow smoke and <i>débris</i>; it could be seen
from miles away and shook the earth like the sudden
outburst of a volcano.  The effects of the eruption
on a narrow space of 600 yards were tremendous.
Trenches on both sides collapsed like packs of cards
under the shock; old landmarks were blotted out,
and right in the centre of the arc of the bow stretched
a line of huge tumbled <i>débris</i>.  In front lay the new
trenches captured by the 3rd British Division on
April 2nd.  Behind lay the remains of the old line,
while the crater stood as an almost impassable bar
between troops holding the one and troops holding
the other.  To get to the new front trench, you had
to enter it from the left or the right, and a line to
which supports cannot be brought up from the
rear is always in grave danger.  So much for the
general position; its particular features have yet to
be considered.
</p>

<p>
We have learned from a study of the French
reports at Verdun what can be effected by
concentrated artillery fire on a selected area.
The frontage at St. Eloi was that of 600 to
1,000 yards, and against it was directed for
over three weeks a colossal concentration of
German fire, answered shell for shell by our
own artillery.  Under the combined efforts of the
artillery of both sides and the result of the mine
explosions, the whole face of the country was
altered.  The "high hills were laid low and the
valleys were exalted" until an officer of the 3rd
British Division who had stayed behind to assist the
newcomers, twice confessed himself utterly unable
to recognise the ground destroyed by man as bearing
any resemblance to the ground he had known
designed by Nature.
</p>

<p>
In this change will be found the explanation of
much that followed.  But there was to be added
another cause, the inclemency of the weather.  In
this battered soil was nothing but mud.  Every
shellhole was a pond, every step might lead one up to the
waist in the sticky element, and earthworks fell in
from the flood as much as from the shell-fire of the
enemy.  It is then under a doubtful star that we must
conceive of the whole action being fought.  The
trenches in the first firing line were little better than
scattered drains&mdash;behind was the crater
barrier&mdash;underfoot were the mud and the water, and above
the unceasing whine of the shells.  The air was
heavy with a damp mist, even by day, and by night
all objects were magnified and uncertain till a
shell-hole appeared a crater, an advance of fifty yards like
one of 500 yards, and an hour grew into years!  The
battle was fought in "No Man's Land"&mdash;a <i>débris</i> of
shattered trees, sudden pool-holes, and upraised
earth, "where no man comes, nor hath come since
the making of the world."
</p>

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-097.jpg" alt="Map--St. Eloi area" />
<br />
Map&mdash;St. Eloi area
</p>

<p>
Into this area the 2nd Division came on the night
of 3rd April.  The 6th Brigade, under Brigadier-General
Ketchen, took over the immediate front,
while the 5th and 4th Brigades were in reserve.  The
post of honour was given to the 27th (Winnipeg)
Battalion, commanded by Lieut.-Col. Snider,
on the right of the line and to the
31st. (Alberta) Battalion, under Lieut.-Col. Bell, on
the left.  The 29th (Vancouver) Battalion, under
Lieut.-Col. Tobin, was in support of the 27th,
while the 28th (North-West) under Lieut.-Col. Embury,
occupied a position behind the craters and
in the centre, with its left supporting the 31st.  It
is on the first two regiments that attention must be
concentrated for the moment, for they had to
occupy the southern thrust of the line and to file
into their new positions from the old line on either
flank.
</p>

<p>
A glance at the map will show the position, while
Gen. Turner has given a lucid description of the
state of the various defences three hours after the
men were in.  From the right of the old British line,
the Canadian communication trench, built by the 4th
Canadian Brigade&mdash;as elsewhere mentioned&mdash;broke
straight out to the left and ran east with a touch of
south, until it met the original German firing trench
at a point known as Sackville Centre, of which we
shall hear more in the future.  The General described
it as 250 yards in length, "a wet, shallow
communication trench."  This was held by a company of
the 27th, under Lieut. Wilson.  Continuing to our left
the line crossed the first of the two roads (that to
Wytschaete) which run from north to south and meet
in St. Eloi; here the front, after going south-east for
about fifty yards, swung round due east until it
reached Bathurst Butts, near the second road; it then
bent sharply north, so as to complete the salient by
striking the old German firing trench again at
Campbelltown Corner.[<a id="chap05fn1text"></a><a href="#chap05fn1">1</a>]  This bit was about 540 yards in
length, and consisted of a deep <i>untraversed</i> firing
trench, with a few firing platforms <i>facing north</i>: that
is, the wrong way.[<a id="chap05fn2text"></a><a href="#chap05fn2">2</a>]  Apparently the 3rd British
Division had been unable to turn it about after they took
it by storm.  The last two hundred yards were&mdash;adds
the General&mdash;badly battered.  The frontage was
fairly evenly divided between two companies of the
27th.  The left-hand company thus secured the most
shaky point in the frontage&mdash;a 200 yards which
proved a miniature gap of Alsace to the Germans.
From Campbelltown Corner to the original British
line the circuit was completed by one company of the
31st.  Here the old British line continued due east
to the canal and was occupied by two more
companies of the 31st, with a third in support.
</p>

<p>
Machine-guns were also posted at intervals along
the line.  It was found necessary, owing to the extent
to which these were being constantly put out of
action, to call for additional guns.  These were
supplied by the 5th Brigade, the 22nd, 24th, 25th, and
26th each sending up a Lewis gun and team; but
they were not available till the night of the 5th just
before the German attack, when they were posted
by Lieut. McLorg, of the 28th.
</p>

<p>
The relief, in the language of the official reports,
was successfully concluded during the night of the
3rd and 4th.  How much doubt, how much discomfort,
how much danger a single sentence can cover!
As the Canadians slipped and struggled along the
wretched drains, or clambered over the places where
shell-fire had destroyed them, they found everywhere
the men of the 61st British Brigade, 3rd British
Division in a state of considerable exhaustion.  They
had been fighting what was practically a continuous
general action for five days under terrific shell-fire.
The last push, which had driven the Germans 200 or
250 yards south of the craters, left the British in such
casual shelter as they could obtain, encumbered with
the dead on both sides and with their own wounded,
whom they were unable to evacuate.  A firing trench
with no direct way in or out from the rear exposes
its occupants to every horror and hardship and
danger.  The supply of food, water, and ammunition, is
intermittent and uncertain, while the knowledge
that supports may take hours to come up in case of
attack is added to the mental torture and physical
staleness induced by a persistent bombardment by
heavy guns.  But the presence of wounded men in a
crowded trench passes the limit of horror.  The
dreadful nature of the injuries inflicted by high
explosive, the irrepressible cries and moans of pain;
the impossibility of bringing relief to the sufferers
form a combination of sight, sound and sensation
which if protracted for many hours absolutely
unnerves the unwounded survivors and forms the
nightmare of their sleep for years.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 3rd and 4th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Even with fair weather and solid defences a night
relief has its trials; under the conditions of the night
of April 3rd, its success was an achievement.  As
the 27th (Winnipeg) and the 31st (Alberta)
succeeded to this bed of thorns, in the pitch dark of
night, they discovered that the officers of the 61st
(British) Brigade, through no fault of theirs, but
owing to the lie of the ground and the
conditions of the assault, could tell them
practically nothing of the whereabouts of the
enemy.  They looked out into a noisy darkness
which covered the Unknown.  Such a state of affairs
is by no means uncommon in trench warfare.
Furthermore, while the line throughout could nowhere be
held continuously, that portion of it between
Bathurst Butts near the second road, and
Campbelltown Corner could only be held by small bombing
posts linked together by visiting patrols.  By
daylight it was altogether untenable for any body of
men in sufficient number to resist a resolute attack.
There was thus a gap sparsely and insecurely
occupied by patrols of the 27th between the left of that
regiment and the right of the 31st Battalion.  This
was the joint in the harness, and against it the
Germans directed a continuous shower of heavy
explosives.
</p>

<p>
It was obvious to the Higher Command that if the
position was to be made secure or even tenable, a
drastic scheme of consolidation must be set on
foot.  General Turner grasped the situation firmly
and clearly; and after consulting General Haldane
(3rd British Division) put forward the following
plan.  He proposed to repair the front line, to dig
communication trenches through the intervals
between the craters, so as to link old and new lines
together, to make good the damage done to the old
line, and finally to dig another trench about
halfway between the firing line and the craters where
supports could be kept handy.  Dummy trenches
were also to be made in the lips of the crater and
both lines wired.  The work was carried out by
small parties, one N.C.O. and a few men of the
28th, centre support battalion, and most of them
were overwhelmed by the German onrush on the
morning of April 6th.
</p>

<p>
This plan would have saved the situation had
time or opportunity been given to carry it out, but
the Fates ruled otherwise.
</p>

<p>
The first thing to do was to evacuate the British
wounded, and this gruesome task was accomplished
during the morning to the accompaniment of heavy
shelling, which began at ten o'clock and lasted at
intervals nearly all day.  Lieut. McCaw and his
company, holding the bad part of the line, endured,
without shifting an inch, a terrible bombardment
which destroyed the greater part of their position
from under their very feet.  Out of the 90 men
present (for 40 had been sent back as there was no
cover for them), 67 were killed or wounded&mdash;a
notable example of endurance.  The trenches were
blown out of existence and men lay down in the
open under what cover they could find.  As one
wounded man was seen to fall, Private Smith
dashed out to render first aid under the shower of
high explosives; he was himself struck down at
once.  Private Bowden went in his turn to the two
men, dressed their wounds, and remained with them
until they both died, with no cover against the rain
of shell except a shovel over his head.
</p>

<p>
Wading in many places waist-deep in the mud,
Capt. Meredith, of the 27th, who behaved with
conspicuous coolness and gallantry in the action which
ensued, found that the day's bombardment had
practically wiped out the position he was to occupy.
There was a little cover on the right, just east of the
second road; but to the left, in the Gap itself, it was
impossible to do more than put out isolated groups
of sentries and bombers, to crouch in shell holes, or
behind improvised shelters, and trust that one would
not be observed.  A single fact speaks volumes;
although Capt. Meredith had only 110 men for his
company, it was found impossible to get cover by
daylight for more than a few isolated posts, and the
remainder of the men had to be sent back in the
early morning of April 5th, to come up again on
their weary journey as soon as it was dark.  There
was, in a word, no longer a line for over 250 yards
of the front.  Some 40 men were trying to hold the
position of a strong company of 200.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night, April 5th and 6th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the following night, that of the 5th and 6th,
it was decided to relieve the two sorely-beset
companies of the 27th.  Capt. Gwynn, of the 29th
Battalion, was to take over from Capt. Meredith the
left of the line, and Lieut. O'Brien, of the same
regiment, was to relieve the company of the 27th
on the right.  It was during the concluding stages
of this relief that the German attack took place.
The blasting fire of our artillery had been well
maintained on the German second and third line
trenches, and it was supposed that this barrage[<a id="chap05fn3text"></a><a href="#chap05fn3">3</a>] had
proved effective in preventing any considerable
force of the enemy reaching through to their own
front line.  This did not prove to be the case.  The
German 214th Battalion, with some units of the
216th, had&mdash;according to the accounts of
prisoners&mdash;succeeded in passing through the barrage into the
front line, from which they launched their assault.
</p>

<p>
On the night of the 5th, the Germans had dashed
through the zone of our artillery fire in a succession
of small parties in extended order, and had thus, by
choosing their occasions, escaped with comparatively
small casualties, and massed in strength within
striking distance of our front.  It may be said that
throughout the action the Germans showed a far
greater aptitude for fighting in small parties than is
usual with them, and that they nowhere attempted
the mass formation attack which has generally been
a prelude to their defeat.
</p>

<p>
But while the Germans are forming up for the
assault at dawn, we must return to the fortunes of
the Canadians.  The working parties are out for the
second night in succession, and a strong second line
trench with barbed wire entanglements has been
constructed in front and south of the craters.  Behind
and north of the craters a third supporting line is
being dug, while the reliefs of the 29th are
struggling up through the delays of mud and
barrage to reach the battered 27th.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night, April 5th and 6th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Capt. Gwynn, of the 29th, had already been
informed that the left of his line would only be
occupied by machine-guns, bombing, and sentry posts,
and with some 40 men, picked out for these danger
posts, he went on ahead of the remainder of his
company and found Capt. Meredith near Bathurst
Butts at 2 o'clock on the morning of the 6th.  The
position was rapidly becoming desperate.  One of
Capt. Meredith's subalterns, Lieut. Dunlop, had been
out under a rain of shells to try to find the original
line to the left, held by the 31st, and the posts
holding it.  He returned to say that he could find no
vestige of either the trench or the posts.  Everything
had been wiped out; and two machine-guns and their
crews perished with the exception of a single man,
who crawled back wounded hours after.  A party of
the 31st who had made a similar attempt to keep
connection from their right, returned with the same
news.  Under the circumstances, Capt. Meredith
could supply no guides into the unoccupied chaos
of shell-holes which represented his left, and the
two officers having completed their relief in the
small fraction of surviving trench, returned to the
nearest telephone, at Fredericton Fort, to get
orders from the Colonel of the 29th Battalion.  It
was at this point in the line alone that the telephone
was working, and that only intermittently, in spite of
the heroic conduct of the signallers in going out into
the open again and again to repair the shattered
wires.  Lieutenant Browne of the 22nd (French
Canadians), of the 4th Brigade, with his machine-gun
party, remained behind with the 40 men of the 29th on
the left of Bathurst Butts.  The two officers and the
men who had been relieved reached Fredericton
Fort successfully at about 2.45 a.m., and found there
several officers of the 27th, and also Lieut. O'Brien
of the 29th, who was trying to relieve Lieut. Wilson's
company of the 27th.  Less fortunate than Capt. Gwynn,
he had not succeeded in finding the officer
he was to replace, but none the less he appears to
have got his men somewhere near the trench he was
to occupy.  This place he found full of stray units,
ration-carrying parties of the 27th, many of whom
had lost their way, and having placed his men in
position, he also returned to the telephone at
Fredericton Fort in the hope of finding someone
in authority.
</p>

<p>
The Canadian communication trench was by this
time practically abandoned under heavy shell-fire.
For the rest, then, one must conceive the remains of
the front line as held, where there was any cover, by
isolated groups of the 29th, intermingled here and
there with men of the 27th who had not been
relieved or who had missed their way, and with a
gaping space on the left.  Beyond this, the line on
the left still held firm for the moment.
</p>

<p>
The 27th Battalion, the relief of which was by
now more or less complete, had suffered a terrible
experience.  It had been almost continuously under
heavy shell fire in hopeless trenches for about sixty
hours, during which sleep, rest, or refreshment had
been practically out of the question.  Major Kitson
had conducted the defence of the first line with skill
and judgment, and the Company Commanders,
Capt. Meredith, Lieut. McCaw, Lieut. Wilson, and
their subalterns had shown great courage and
coolness in the face of adverse circumstances.
Lieut. R. E. N. Jones, of the same battalion, met a gallant
death in the early morning of the attack in an
attempt to keep touch with and collect the left of
the regiment during the retirement.  He went out
into the open under a terrific fire and was killed
almost instantly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 6th, 3 A.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was by now three o'clock of a misty morning;
and as the officers around the telephone dug-out
discovered that the line was cut, and were taking
counsel together, the German artillery preparation
began.
</p>

<p>
The shelling&mdash;heavy but intermittent&mdash;rose to a
roar and the night overhead became pandemonium,
while the ground underneath shook with the
concussion or dissolved under the explosions.  Officers
endeavoured to rejoin their units, but it most cases
found it impossible, and every group turned to their
official or natural leader for orders.  It is easy for
those whose experience of the movements of bodies
of men is confined to reviews in peace time, or to
the organisation of a big political demonstration,
to consider that this state of affairs is not to be
expected of an army.  Such a view simply springs
from ignorance of conditions.  Not here was a
broad plain, smiling in the sun, on which battalions
could be moved with uniformity; or the familiar
pavements, where every street turning is known to
the marshals of the delegations; not here the
frictionless chess-board of the war game, with its moves
pondered silently long in advance.  The ground on
which to move is certain death; the shattered and
almost impassable trenches; the vast distance away
in time of any supports; the blindness in the sense
of direction which affects nearly every man on
unknown country in the dark; the line of craters
behind and the noise of the shells overhead: these
are the elements making up the picture of the
situation which, on that April morning, the 6th Canadian
Brigade had to face.  The rifles and machine-guns
on which armed men are accustomed to depend for
their lives, were half-clogged and useless.  The
very position of the enemy was unknown.  But the
native hardihood of the race asserted itself; groups
made up of every unit formed themselves for the
struggle for existence, fought where they could and
retreated or died when the choice became retirement
or passive annihilation.

On this scene of incertitude and disturbance the
day began to break.  It was the hour when men
rub their eyes and shiver in the cool air and stand to
arms to meet that period which is most likely to
bring the attack.  The light of dawn, stealthy and
suspicious, was showing in the east over a scene of
ruin and desolation, and in this valley of dry bones
something began to move.  To the group of watchers
in the trenches dark forms advancing could be seen
through the mist.  They came straight on without
hesitating up the St. Eloi-Wytschaete road,
towards Sackville Centre.  It was known to our men
that some Pioneers were out in that direction wiring
the front.  A whisper of doubt ran along the line.
Were they the enemy or one of our working parties
gone astray?  One group evidently had made up its
mind, and a sputter of fire broke out&mdash;how different
in volume and intensity, alas! from the full-throated
crash of musketry from a strongly-held, well-filled
trench!  It was enough, at any rate, for the
Germans.  They had thought to find nothing alive in
the area on which their guns had wrought such
havoc.  The dark line turned half-right and swung
round like a wave, seeking an inlet through some
rocky barrier.  Instantly every gun and rifle which
would work was brought to bear.  But the result was
one to break the hearts of men trained to regard
their weapons as their unfailing friends in the hour
of need and danger.  The foul mud splashed over
them in torrents by the bombardment had worked
into breech and magazine, and men threw down
their choked rifles with curses, and snatched for one
left behind by some dead or wounded man.  But
these, too, after a shot or two, refused to do their
work!  All along the line the remaining Lewis guns
jammed, groups were too isolated to make a
concerted counter-attack with the bayonet; and the
Germans passed along our front until they found the
fatal gap in the line.  As they came opposite the
last post on our left, Lieut. Browne, a machine-gunner
of the 22nd French Canadians, turned his
Lewis gun and what rifles the party had full on to
them at short range.  Some fifteen or twenty
Germans were seen to fall, and the remainder threw
themselves flat on their faces.  Then the inevitable
happened, and the gun went out of action.  As the
fire dribbled away to the crack of a single rifle, the
enemy jumped up, swung to the left of the outpost,
and headed straight through the undefended breach
for the craters 150 yards behind.
</p>

<p>
The light had now grown brighter, and the officers
at Sackville Centre could see the Germans breaking
through to Craters 2 and 3.  They turned their
remaining men half-left rear, and fired with every
rifle which would work.  But the damage was done.
The working parties on the second line, which was
being built in front of the craters, had been
withdrawn before light, and the small groups of the
28th Battalion in the craters themselves must have
been overpowered by the 200 or 300 Germans who
broke in on them.  Once over the rim, the enemy
were for the moment safe, and they promptly set
about digging themselves in, and getting the
machine-guns they had brought with them into
position.
</p>

<p>
In all, then, some 200 or 300 Germans succeeded
in occupying the two craters on the right of our
position.  From this point they began to work towards
our left, and in the course of the day or the following
night became possessed of Craters 4 and 5.  This
movement would have placed them in the rear of
the men of the 31st Battalion at Campbelltown
Corner had that still been occupied.  As a
matter of fact, however, the extreme right and south
position of the 31st had been abandoned and
destroyed in the course of the preliminary bombardment.
At dawn a tremendous fire had been directed on the
top line towards Shelley Farm,[<a id="chap05fn4text"></a><a href="#chap05fn4">4</a>] and the trench
between Campbelltown Corner and the old British line
became untenable.  To stay in it was certain and
useless death.  Part of its garrison got back into the
original line.  Other parties occupied the two small
and ancient Craters 6 and 7, immediately in advance
of it, under the impression, arrived at without due
thought, that these were Craters 4 and 5; while one
platoon cut off by the barrage moved to their left
into an old advanced trench which afforded them
some cover.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 6th, 4:30 A.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
At 4.30 in the morning, or an hour after the attack
on the 27th, about 200 of the enemy made a second
attack and attempted to overwhelm the party
holding Craters 7 and 6; Major Doughty, of the 31st,
organised the defence with skill and resolution.  He
allowed the Germans to advance within effective
range, and then brought a concentric fire to bear on
them.  The isolated platoon enfiladed them on the
left, the men in the craters enfiladed them on the
right, while the original occupants of the old front
line just behind and to the left of the craters mowed
them down from the front.  The attack recoiled in
confusion.

</p>

<p>
Some fled, others threw themselves down into
shell-holes and lay there unobserved as long
as the daylight lasted.  Our line was suffering
now the fate of a taut rope cut in the centre.
Each end recoiled instinctively to its point
of connection with the old British trenches.  It
cannot be maintained that the retirement on the
right, albeit it was from an untenable position, was
carried out in a very skilled or organised fashion.
This fact was due partly to the general nature of
the ground and the situation, which has been sufficiently
dwelt on, and partly to the number of different
units on the same front.  The time of relief&mdash;and
the relief of the 27th was not yet fully accomplished
though nearly so&mdash;with two sets of officers and men
on the same front moving contrary ways, is always a
period of some little confusion, and for that reason
reliefs are not carried out at dawn, because it is the
likely time for an attack.  In this case the
circumstances made it impossible to get the reliefs up
earlier.  But, apart from this, there were small
parties of Pioneers scattered about in or in front of
the line.  It was not, of course, the business of these
latter to await the Germans, but to get back into
their own line, but the precipitancy and thoroughness
with which they executed this movement added
to the prevailing disturbance.  At any rate, on the
right every party from Bathurst Butts and the
extreme right of their original line was between two
fires and in imminent danger of being surrounded.
So the scattered groups began to retire towards
Sackville Centre and Fredericton Fort, where
Capts. Gwynn and Meredith were organising the
defence.  Their party consisted of some subalterns
of both their regiments, sixteen men of the 27th, and
five Pioneers.  These officers determined to hold on
in spite of the heavy machine-gun fire from the
craters in the rear, and to give time for the more
easterly parties to rally on them.  They got the
telephone to work and asked for reinforcements; they
tried to establish a continuous line down the
Canadian communication trench, which had been deserted
at its easterly end, and they asked for fire to be
directed on the captured craters from the guns and
trench mortars.  Col. Snider, of the 27th, was the
nearest Commanding Officer to them, and he did his
utmost to come to their assistance.  Their last
request verged on the heroic, for their own trenches
were only a hundred yards beyond those of the
enemy, and their precise position could not be known
to our gunners far to the rear.  All this time men
were falling fast.  The cover was poor, and to show
one's head was to invite an almost inevitable bullet.
None the less, Lieut. Jackson, of the 29th,
volunteered to go out with four men of the 27th and try
to locate more precisely the positions the enemy
had taken up.  So murderous was the fire that
within a few minutes he and one private returned
alone.  The other three had been killed almost
instantly.
</p>

<p>
The requests for assistance from guns and men
from the Brigade could not be very adequately
met.  The Higher Command were under a double
difficulty.  In the first place, so heavy was the
German fire on the communication trenches that
it was impossible to move supports up to them
in the daylight hours of that morning.  In the
second place, the continual breakdown in the
telephone service made all information as to the
precise state of affairs in the front line impossible
to obtain from minute to minute.  In so far, however,
as messages came through they continued to confirm
the original evidence which had given the Brigade
a radically false view of the whole situation.  The
view of the Brigade was that the Germans were
simply a small raiding party who had broken through
a weakly-held part of the line and seized on Crater 2,
and possibly Crater 3.  There they were, surrounded
on every side except that by which they had come in,
by parties of our troops in the closest proximity to
them.  Capts. Gwynn and Meredith were close
behind their line on the right; and it was quite
wrongly believed that Major Daly and the 31st were
cheek by jowl with them in Craters 4 and 5 on the
left; in the centre, of course, was our main force.
To start a heavy bombardment was therefore
impossible, for it would have killed more Canadians
than Germans; it would have been using a
steam-hammer to crack a nut and cracking one's own
finger instead.  A bombing and rifle attack was the
only way to deal with such intruders.  That was
the obvious argument, and it would have been
correct had the premises on which it was based borne
any relation to the facts.  The difficulties with which
General Ketchen was confronted can best be
appreciated in the light of the fact that he was not
definitely informed till 5 o'clock on the morning of
the 6th that the two Craters&mdash;2 and 3&mdash;were lost, and
that all communication with the front then ceased
for two and a half hours!  As it was, under the
urgent pressure of Col. Snider, of the 27th, and
Capt. Gwynn, artillery fire was finally opened on
Crater 2.
</p>

<p>
The trench mortars in our original right-hand
trenches, whose gunners were near enough to see
what they were doing, were out of action.  Eventually,
however, some 18-pounders were turned on the
enemy.  Capt. Gwynn, who observed the bombardment
by Fredericton Fort, was doubtful of its
efficacy, but the testimony of prisoners taken during
the ensuing night proves that the garrison of Crater 2
lost heavily, though not heavily enough to induce
them to retire.  But the main reliance was placed on
a bombing and infantry attack from the north and
north-east, and the 28th Battalion, which had not
yet been in action, was ordered to come up from its
trenches behind the centre of the position and assist
in the assault.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, the isolated parties of the 27th
and the 29th were making their way back as best
they could from the east to the rallying point in front
of Crater 1.  The stories of these successive
retirements will, in the main, never be told&mdash;for too often
they were cut short by death.  The machine-gun
teams of the 5th Brigade were also involved in the
retreat.  Lieut. Browne commanded the 22nd,
Sergt. Naylor the 24th, Lieut. White the 25th,
Lieut. Lockhart the 26th.  Of all these, only one
gun was brought out of action&mdash;that of
Sergt. Naylor, of the 24th Battalion, who showed great
presence of mind in mitigating the confusion of the
mixed units in the retreat, and saved the majority of
his team.  The character of the force is well
illustrated by the private occupations of his team.  The
sergeant was a storekeeper, Lance-Cpl. Rose
a patternmaker, Lance-Cpl. Duley a bank teller,
Private Arundel a ledger-keeper, Private Clarke a
salesman, Private Burchell a private secretary.
</p>

<p>
The parties of the 25th and 26th were never seen
again.  They must presumably have perished, and
their stories with them.  One tale, however,
survives&mdash;and that is the march of Lieut. Browne of the
22nd (French Canadians) and his detachment
across the front and through the lines of the
enemy.  As has been already related, Lieut. Browne
found himself on our extreme left with a
Lewis gun when Capt. Gwynn went back for
instructions.  He fired on the Germans and saw them
pass behind him to the crater.  "The enemy," he
says, "marched in absolute silence until I opened
fire, and they extended and began to shout as they
ran forward.  In my opinion the enemy did not
think that the front line was occupied, which would
account for their advancing in close order until
struck by our fire."  As the enemy swung round his
left, there was no outbreak of fire from the Lewis
gun of the 25th Battalion&mdash;it had been buried and
its crew presumably killed.  Every gun and rifle
save one having jammed, and the enemy being well
behind the line, Lieut. Browne took his decision.
"Not being able to do any effective work and
believing the other crews to be out of action; also
seeing the enemy closing on the left towards the
craters, I decided to retire to the second line, there
to unite with the garrison to make a stand."  The
party, which consisted of five men of the 22nd and
a few others, accordingly started back north,
following in the wake of the advancing Germans.  There
was, however, no garrison in our newly-dug second
line south of the craters, for the working party had
gone.  Instead they encountered the barbed wire the
working parties had put in front of the trench.
The Germans, by now on the edge of the craters,
fired on them as they were struggling through.
Lance-Cpl. Lambert, Private Rattè, Private Brisebois,
and a man of the 25th fell, but as they gained
the other side they came across a digging party which
had lost its way, and had not gone back with the
others.  Hastily gathering these men, Lieut. Browne
charged for the spot where they had been fired on.
Not a man had a rifle which would work, but they
rushed in like the paladins of romance on the armed
Germans who were in the trench.  These they killed
in hand-to-hand conflict with the butts of their rifles.
Alter this notable feat of arms the party got into the
new second line trench and proceeded along it
towards Fredericton Fort.  As they came running
down the trench, the Germans came out of the crater
against them, but Lieut. Browne's detachment
managed to elude the enemy.  Picking up some of the
29th, and the gun crew of the 24th on the way, Lieut.
Browne succeeded in reaching Fredericton Fort,
where he found Capts. Gwynn and Meredith.  Of
his original section only two remained alive.  None
the less, each new group had rallied round this
officer, and were "ready for a fight at any time."  Such
a story of valour and discretion exceeds all
that fiction has ever imagined.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 6th, 7 A.M.</i>
</span>
At 7 a.m. on the
morning of the 6th, all telephone communication
with the officers at Fredericton Fort ceased.  The
last message which came through to Capt. Gwynn
(as appeared subsequently) from the Canadian
communication trench was a simple and tragic one:
"<i>We are retiring</i>."  Isolated by now on both right
and left, and with the enemy in front and rear,
Capt. Gwynn still held firm until he was reasonably certain
that the last party from the abandoned line had
come in.  Finally, some two hours afterwards, no
orders having been received, as indeed they could
not be, he decided to retire.  His men were falling
fast in an impossible position and no alternative
was open to him.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, a message asking for the support of
the machine-guns in our original trenches on the
right had got through, and under cover of their fire
and the shelling of the Crater 2 by our 18-pounders,
Capt. Gwynn conducted a successful retirement to
the old lines.  In this emergency the 27th and the
29th were ably led, and seconded their officers'
efforts to the last.  The news of this final movement
on the right did not reach the Brigade until some
time later in the day.
</p>

<p>
With this retirement the first phase of the battle
comes to an end.  The new line has been indubitably
lost with the exception of a few outpost positions
like the minor craters, and the remainder of the
prolonged struggle is devoted to the attempt to
reoccupy by a series of counter-attacks ground which
has been abandoned, and to oust the enemy from the
craters.  It will be well to defer to a later stage a
full consideration of all the circumstances which
prevented a successful issue, but something may be
said with advantage on the fighting from the night
of April 3rd, when the Canadian 2nd Division took
over, to the morning of the 6th, when the German
advance succeeded.  It is inevitable that the mere
event should leave behind it a certain trace of
bitterness.  To lose trenches, however indefensible, can
never be pleasant.  Failure must differ from success
whatever the real merits of the case may be.  And it
is part of the tragedy of modern warfare that the
real conditions which make such a retirement
unavoidable can never be understood to the full by
those who have not gone through the experience of a
general action in trench warfare.  No word painting,
however vivid, can make the picture actual to minds
which have mercifully been preserved from the
experience and to eyes which have never seen a
modern battlefield.  The shock of squadrons, the
bayonet charge, or the exchange of point-blank
volleys between opposing battalions has become
familiar to us in history-books, and the artist can
draw them to the life.  It is easy to grasp the recoil
of a column down the hill-side under the furious
impetus of an overwhelming assault.  But to be
killed in sections by high explosives and machine-guns
in a trench which is rapidly ceasing to exist, so
that the agony is prolonged for hours, is an
ordeal more difficult to grasp.  The mere reiteration
of its horrors dulls the sense of the reader as the
actuality strains the nerves of the soldier.  Every
sentence would have to end with the word "shell."  The
knowledge that to stay is useless because no
attack will be made while anyone remains alive; that
to bring up supports is impossible under the barrage,
and that anyone who came would merely share your
fate; the impossibility of keeping pace with the
destruction of your only cover; the biting fire from
rear, front and flank; the impotence of gripping a
useless rifle&mdash;these things are indeed worse than the
bitterness of death!  The men of the 6th Brigade
were right in retiring as soon as the line was
broken and had become indefensible, and when no
supports could be brought up to their assistance.
But, apart from the unavoidable necessities of
the case, the 2nd Division suffered from ill-luck.
In all military operations luck is of primary
importance, because even the best planned and most
carefully executed schemes are met by such
unexpected changes and conditions that they go to ruin
through the Unforeseen.  Every commander must
expect a reasonable share of the favours of fortune.
That share was in this action conspicuously lacking.
The mistake about the identity of the Craters 4 and 5
was the beginning of all the trouble.  Had the 31st
Battalion occupied these instead of Craters 6 and 7,
when they were blown out of Campbelltown Corner,
they might have checked the whole enemy advance
and made the Germans in Craters 2 and 3 what they
were for long believed to be by the Higher Command,
an isolated group partly surrounded by the Canadians.
The initial mistake was the precipitate action
and belief of the 31st Battalion, due to the fact that
no one knew the ground as it had been transformed
by mine and shell fire.  But the results of the blunder
were cumulative.
</p>

<p>
The counter-attack on the night of the 6th-7th&mdash;dealt
with in the next chapter&mdash;by the 27th and 31st
Battalions confirmed and exaggerated the error by
failing to get to the real craters, although the men of
these battalions were firmly convinced that they <i>had</i>
done so.  They found men holding what they thought
to be Crater 5, and naturally believed them.  The
result was to immobilise our artillery during the
crucial phase of the action and for days afterwards.
Had we known that the whole crater line in the
centre was held by the Germans, we could almost
certainly have blown them out of it.  As it was our
gunners were crippled by the fear of destroying the
positions of their own infantry.  Such a mistake is
no doubt "the luck of war," and in the ordinary
course of events it would soon have been rectified by
the photographic pictures taken by our aeroplanes.
But here came the crowning blow of a malignant
fortune.  All through the first fortnight of the action
a great gale blew.  It not only hindered our actions
on the surface of the earth, but it absolutely stopped
them in the air.  No aeroplane could go up in it,
and the vital facts of the position were hidden from
the commanders until the morning of April 16th.
</p>

<p>
Confronted by all these adverse circumstances, the
companies of the 27th, 29th and the 31st did all
that mortal men could do.  In the face of heavy
casualties, and holding positions under intolerable
artillery fire, they stood their ground firmly so long
as defence was possible, and retired, in rallying
groups when to hold on was merely suicide they
did not command success; they deserved it.

[<a href="#chap05fn1text">1</a>] The whole of this line from the Canadian communication

[<a href="#chap05fn2text">2</a>] A traverse is the projection of earth back into the firing trench

without traverses is therefore very dangerous.

The firing platform is a ledge of earth from one to two feet

parapet.  It follows from this that until he gets up on the
platform he can, in a good trench, walk about freely, without
exposing his head to the enemy.  Here, of course, the trench was a
German one, and in consequence the parapet and platform were
on the north side of the trench, whereas we wanted them on the
south side.  The first thing to do in capturing a trench from the
enemy is to seize the sandbags of the parapet and to drag them

them.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 6th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
With the morning of April 6th began that series
of counter-attacks against the Germans which
continued at intervals during the remainder of the
action.
</p>

<p>
Here, in estimating the causes of success or failure,
three factors are of primary importance: the general
lie of the land and the consequent disposition of
our troops on it; the concentrated fire of the enemy's
heavy artillery; and the state of the weather and the
subsoil.  None of these factors was in our favour,
and though taken singly their hostility need not have
proved fatal, taken in conjunction they formed as
grave an obstacle to victory as any general has
encountered.
</p>

<p>
The knoll of St. Elbi is in itself of no great
magnitude.  From the plateau which it crowns the
ground drops suddenly to the south and the German
second line trenches.  But though it possesses this
local advantage it is in its turn dominated both by
the rise at Eikhof Farm some 1,000 yards to the
east and by gun positions well back in the German
line.  This drawback was aggravated by the fact
that, like most positions, such as Hooge or Hill 60,
in the Ypres salient, it could be subjected to a
converging fire from the front and either flank.  The
German observers could thus look north past the
knoll, and watching any signs of the movements of
our troops far behind the line, turn on them a
rain of shells from at least three points of the
compass.  The Canadian Higher Command was compelled
in consequence to order the dispositions of
the troops accordingly.  The divisional frontage
was taken by only one brigade with two battalions
in the advance positions.  The centre and support
battalion had to find cover farther back, while the
reserve battalion was right back near Dickebusch
nearly three miles away.  Such a dispersion
cannot but be disadvantageous.  But the
configuration of the ground would have been of less
importance had there been no great concentration of
German guns to face.  Such a collection of heavy
pieces takes days to assemble or disperse, and is
not therefore to be looked for on the side of the
defence.  The enemy, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, should have
been taken by surprise when the craters were blown
up and the 3rd British Division attacked, and plenty
of time given to the assailants to consolidate the
new position before a great concentration of guns
could be brought to bear on them.  But this did
not happen, by a simple piece of bad luck, as has
been related in Chapter IV.  In February the British
Division holding the Bluff to the north of St. Eloi,
just east of the Canal, and included in the
subsequent Canadian position, had some trenches there
snatched from them.  They took the matter calmly;
got up the heavy batteries, including even the
monstrous 15-inch guns, blew the Bluff practically to
pieces, and took back the lost ground on March 2nd.
This performance caused keen irritation to the
Germans, who looked round for the best spot on which
to retaliate, and selected St. Eloi.  The troops then
who carried the new line, and the Canadians, who
had to hold it, found a ready-prepared artillery
concentration against them from the moment they
started.  The whole area was laid waste, and the old
British line in the centre, and many of the support
and communication trenches behind it, were rendered
untenable.

<p>
Depth then, not length, is the distinguishing
feature of the section occupied by the 2nd Canadian
Division.  And here the third factor comes into play,
the state of the soil.  In war, distance, time, and
energy are interchangeable terms.  The interval
between a line and its supports is not to be measured
by the number of yards between them, but by the
time it will take to traverse and by the amount of
fatigue involved in the process.  Undisturbed earth
under rain forms mud, but in a country which is not
marshy it can be crossed somehow.  But earth
disintegrated by high explosive and drowned in water
becomes pulp.  One can wade through water, or
struggle over mud, but this stuff was neither.  As
men splashed from shell-hole to shell-hole&mdash;and the
surface of the earth consisted of nothing else&mdash;they
sank up to the armpits and could find no grip for
their feet.  One of the strongest men in the 2nd
Division has declared that after sixty yards of this
work he was incapable of going further.
</p>

<p>
To make new&mdash;or, worse still, to repair
old&mdash;trenches out of this material was impossible.  Add
darkness for a night attack, and the picture is
complete.  Even by daylight, parties reported in
the utmost good faith that they had reached such
and such a point on the map, when, as a matter of
fact, they had done nothing of the kind, for all the
old landmarks had vanished.  Yet it was on this
information that schemes of attack had to be based.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Morning, April 6th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the 6th, as soon as the enemy
attack was known of at Headquarters, a forward
movement of the supports and reserves of the 6th
Brigade began.  Two companies of the 29th were
already up with the 27th in the original British
trenches and the new Canadian line beyond, and a
bombing party followed them into the former
position.  The 28th occupied Voormezeele in the
support centre line, where they were subjected to as
severe a shelling as any experienced in the forward
trenches.  Two battalions, 18th (Western Ontario),
commanded by Lieut.-Col. Wigle, and 21st (Eastern
Ontario), under Lieut.-Col. Hughes, of the 4th
Brigade, took their places at Dickebusch in reserve.
Two counter-attacks were then organised.  The
attacks were to be simultaneous and converging.
From the right of the line the bombers of the 27th
and the 29th were to head an assault against Craters
2 and 3, which lay to the south-east of the original
line.  From the left-centre of the line, the bombers
of the 28th and 31st Battalions were to re-occupy
Craters 4 and 5, should these have been abandoned,
moving in a south-westerly direction.  The men of
these two regiments had to come up from well
behind St. Eloi on to ground with which they were
utterly unfamiliar, and from which all landmarks
had been blotted out.  As they advanced through
the half-ruined communications in the full light of
day, the German observers caught a glimpse of
them and a tremendous barrage of fire was turned
on them.  Dashing through this, they saw in front of
them the outlines of two craters and immediately
assumed that their objective was before them.  No
one knew at the time which craters on our left
were in German hands, and as has been noted
before, the 31st under Major Doughty, when they
evacuated their forward position at the time of
attack, were firmly convinced that they had seized
Craters 4 and 5, whereas they had actually
occupied Craters 6 and 7, and from these repulsed
the assault.
</p>

<p>
It was into these two craters that the bombers of
the two battalions broke, and found one still
occupied by a party of the 31st, and the other abandoned
under a rain of shells.  They reported accordingly,
and the original error was again confirmed in the
minds of the Brigade.  In the meantime, the raid on
Craters 2 and 3 had come to grief.  It was delivered
across the open, where the only cover was shell-holes,
in face of a sweeping machine-gun fire from
the German redoubts in the craters, backed by their
gunners behind their lines.  To advance in the face
of this hail of death was impossible, and finally the
attempt was abandoned.
</p>

<p>
An attack organised for 1.30 a.m. on April 6th
was postponed while our artillery bombarded the
craters.  All through the day the German barrage
hardly lifted, but it was decided to make a new push
against Craters 4 and 5, then supposed to be Craters
2 and 3, as soon as the dark descended.  But at
dusk the Germans themselves took the initiative for
a moment.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>6 P.M., April 6th, 1916.</i>
</span>
When the 31st had repulsed the attack
at dawn on the 6th, they imagined that the surviving
Germans had made a final retirement.  This proved
not to be the case; some 50 or 60 of them had
flung themselves flat down in the shell-holes in front
of Craters 6 and 7 and the trenches on our left,
and had remained crouching there all day.  As
evening fell, they leapt up suddenly and charged
the 31st.  A withering rifle fire swept the enemy's
groups, which faded out of existence.  Some fell
and some fled, but a few dropped back again into
their shell-holes, and remained there during the
night.  The strain appears to have been too much
for the nerves of the survivors.  Driven mad by
their position and the fire of our artillery, they
leapt up again at dawn on the 7th, and with
their rifles slung danced "like Red Indians," as
an eye-witness observed, in front of the Canadian
lines.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the 6th, the 28th were coming
up in successive parties to the support of the right
of that hard-tried Battalion, and had effected a
junction with Major Daly (31st) behind our own craters.
Their instructions were to pick up bombers of the
31st and to assault and capture Craters 2 and 3.
They actually advanced against Craters 4 and 5.
The bombing attack was led by Lieut. V. P. Murphy
(25th), who succeeded in establishing himself nearer
the hostile craters than any previous advance had
done.  He was supported by Capt Styles (28th), who
exposed himself with the greatest gallantry in the
continuous attempt to keep touch with the various
scattered units of the 28th and the 31st.  But the
mud was almost impassable, the darkness intense,
the position of the enemy uncertain, and the ground
a mere mass of holes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Dawn, April 7th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Dawn found the Canadian infantry still
entrenched in Craters 6 and 7, but with no visible
progress towards the enemy positions.  The
attacking parties had lost their way or been
overwhelmed by sheer exhaustion.  This is the more
remarkable, because it is clear that the Germans
were throughout the night in position in Craters 4
and 5.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night, April 6th-7th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
It thus appears that throughout the night of
April 6th-7th, the enemies can only have been
separated by the distance of less than forty yards,
between Craters 6 and 5.  In fact, a few German
patrols, as much confused as their opponents,
walked straight into the Canadian craters in the
dark and were taken prisoners!  And yet neither
side succeeded in coming to grips with the other.
It was as though an impenetrable curtain had fallen
between the contending parties of infantry.  The
mud, the darkness, and the shells made every
movement a failure.  That such a state of affairs could
be possible can only be understood by the insight of
imagination or by an actual experience of the
ground and the conditions.  But a study of the
photographs taken by aeroplanes makes it at least
intelligible.  Among the infinite traceries of lines,
trenches new and old, which wrinkle the surface of
the chart, the rims of the four great centre craters
stand out ominous and distinct.  We actually see
down into the hollows held by the lurking Germans
as one gazes through the sunlit depths of a
rock-bound pool to where the tiny monsters of the deep
dart in and out of their caves and recesses upon the
clear floor of the sea.  Away to the right lies Crater
1, a perfect circle of light and shade with its foliated
edges like the milling on the rim of a coin.  Across
a flattish, almost unmarked surface, the Canadian
and the British communication trenches drive north
and south of it from the strong serrated line of our
own trenches, until they strike the intricate tangle of
the old German front line.  But turn your eyes to the
centre and to the ground which lies directly between
St. Eloi and the craters.  The old outstanding
British position on the right crumbles away into
a vague tangle of flattened outlines.  Behind it
the whole surface of the ground is pockmarked
with the white dots which indicate shell-holes,
and in front of it there is no solid earth at all,
but a bewildering labyrinth of minor craters
spreading out till they touch the four huge
eruptions.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-130"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-130.jpg" alt="St. Eloi Craters" />
<br />
St. Eloi Craters
</p>

<p>
On the left the space is a trifle more open.  Craters
6 and 7 held by us can be distinguished as mere holes
separated by some forty or fifty yards from the
giant rim of Crater 5.  From high up it looks so
clear, but to the men struggling in the dark over
that quagmire, sweating to dig themselves in by
daylight under the pitiless hail of death, it appeared
confusion worse confounded.  Looking down from
a great altitude on the passionless picture in high
relief it is hard to imagine that here men battled in
the mud till they could do so no more, and tasted
the bitterness of failure as they fought and died for
their country.  The photographic record seems cold
compared with the ideals and efforts the result of
which it enshrines.  One turns from it as one might
turn from the privacy of the human soul outraged
by Omniscience.  All this chaos was to the
advantage of the Germans once they had seized the
dominant position.
</p>

<p>
From the rear came continued orders to take the
enemy's entrenchments at any cost, and a constant
trickle of reinforcements was sent struggling up the
communication trenches or dashing across the open
in groups the moment the barrage lifted.  But in the
conditions existing at the front, all these groups
seemed to melt away.  Units went up and were heard
of no more at Headquarters.  The bare official
reports are tragic.  One can select any one at random;
for instance, this from Lieut.-Col. Embury, of the
28th:&mdash;"I told Capt. A. G. Styles (28th) he was to
come around north of the craters.  He started off
at 11.30 and left part of his men with Major Daly.
It was dark and raining hard and we had never seen
the ground before.  The craters looked just like the
ordinary ground.  Styles went up and found
Lieut. V. P. Murphy (25th) at 4 o'clock a.m., but had no
time to fix up for the attack.  The men were all
in; they had only had three hours' sleep in
forty-eight."
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night, April 6th-7th, 1916.</i>
</span>
But it is impossible for the contemporary
writer in the space at his disposal to give a clear
and detailed picture of the movements of all these
units or of the valour displayed by individuals.
The fog of war lies heavy on the scene of confusion
and heroic effort, and if (which is very unlikely) it
is to be lifted at all, it must be by the hand of
the future historian.  The troops did their best,
but the odds both of man and Nature were
against them.  The 28th Battalion throughout the
fighting set a notable example of gallantry and
endurance.
</p>

<p>
That night of April 6th-7th the Germans effected
their relief.
</p>

<p>
They had, by all accounts of prisoners, suffered
very severely from the fire of our artillery&mdash;but they
had held on, retiring by a perverse stroke of irony
to our own second line trench dug south of the crater
when the bombardment became intolerable.  It
cannot be questioned that if we had been fully aware of
the relative positions of the two forces the British
artillery could have blown their opponents bodily
out of the craters.
</p>

<p>
That night, too, the 4th Brigade began to come
up to the relief.  The 6th Brigade had done its best;
it had been fighting continuously for three days and
nights; its supply of rations had been intermittent;
many of its officers and men had had no sleep for
days, and the exhaustion bred of shell-fire and mud
was upon it.  Its casualties were in all 617 officers
and men.  The 27th had borne the brunt of the first
German onrush and suffered proportionately.  Eight
of its officers and 209 of its rank and file had been
killed or wounded.  The 31st, which held its line
for the longest period in the Brigade, came next with
a roll of 180 casualties.  The 29th lost 117, and the
28th, 101.  The Brigade had failed, but it had failed
gloriously!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 7th-8th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The relief could only be accomplished by degrees.
To move large bodies of men up simultaneously was
impracticable, and the fighting was therefore
continued by mixed battalions of the two brigades.
The 4th Brigade, under General Rennie, consisted
of the 18th (Western Ontario), commanded by
Lieut.-Col. Wigle; 19th (Ontario), under
Lieut.-Col. J. T. Maclaren; 20th (Northern and Central Ontario),
under Lieut.-Col. C. H. Rogers, and the 21st (Eastern
Ontario), under Lieut.-Col. Hughes.  In effect, the
relief, which lasted over four nights, put the 21st
instead of the 27th on the right in the trenches, the
18th replacing the 28th in the centre support
position; while the 19th took the place of the 31st on
our left and in the Canadian craters.  But the Higher
Command of the 2nd Division, which exhibited
throughout great determination, was not content
to await the full relief before it launched a new
attack on the enemy.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night, April 8th-9th, 1916.</i>
</span>
On the night of the 8th-9th
fresh assault was launched against Craters 2 and 3.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
ATTACK ON THE GERMANS NIGHT OF 8TH TO 9TH APRIL 1916
</p>

<p>
The object of this attack was to effect a lodgment
on the north-west side of Crater 2 and on the north
side of Crater 3&mdash;that is to say, to secure a position
where the St. Eloi-Wytschaete road passes through
the craters and bends to the right.  The assault
on the right was led by Capt. Miller, of the 21st,
who was wounded during the engagement.  He and
a small bombing party succeeded in getting to the
edge of Crater 2 under a heavy fire, and in the
blackness of the night crept up unobserved.  Here
Pte. Comego had his right arm shattered.  In spite
of his excruciating agony he managed to control
himself when a single sound would have given away
the presence of the whole party.  They had expected
to find only about twenty of the enemy, but,
discovering a far stronger force, beat a retreat to
secure reinforcements.  Fifty more men of the
21st went up with Lieut. Brownlee, who
distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry, to
make a renewed attempt.  By this time, however,
the alarm had been given, and such a tornado of fire
was turned on "No Man's Land" that the attack
stuck fast.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>3.30 A.M., April 9th, 1916.</i>
</span>
At 3.30 in the morning the exhausted
survivors succeeded in struggling back to the trench.
In the course of the advance and of vigorous
exchange of bombs with the Germans, they had lost
three-fourths of their number.
</p>

<p>
Great bravery was displayed by many men of the
21st.  Sniper Zacharias used his rifle in the assault
until it was blown out of his hands; he then
became a grenadier and hurled bombs at the
Germans until his party retired.  Two lance-corporals,
Currie and Henderson, made heroic efforts to drag
the wounded back into the trench under heavy and
continuous fire.  As a result practically all the
wounded of the 21st were evacuated by the
stretcher-bearers.
</p>

<p>
The attack on Crater 3 by the 18th met with no
better success.  Lieut. Kerr, who had reconnoitred
the ground on the previous evening, led the party
on, but the heavy barrage of the enemy checked the
progress, and finally they had to content themselves
with re-occupying the old British line and putting
an outpost position in advance of it, fifty yards in
front of the German crater.
</p>

<p>
The 18th (Western Ontario) fought throughout
with great courage.  Lieut. Kerr was wounded, and
Lieut. Baxter had been untiring in the most
dangerous form of reconnaissance, working on unknown
ground; Lieut. Elliott, the signal officer, went out
over and over again into the open to establish and
keep connection between the front position and
battle headquarters, and was well backed by his men.
But, as in the case of the 21st, in this attack the
great difficulty was to bring in the wounded.
Capt. McKeough, Company Sergt.-Major Richardson,
Sergt. Cunningham, Sergt. Bowie, and
Lance-Cpl. Evans dashed out time after time to
bring the casualties in.  Private Tom Jones, said to
have been in turn a deserter from the British Army,
the British Navy, and the American Army, though
quite a young boy, lost his life at this stage of
the action.  He had been helping to carry
Lieut. Clarke (18th), who was wounded, into safety,
and on returning to guide an officer up, was shot
clean through the head, to the grief of his regiment.
The attack had suffered heavily, losing 100 men in
killed and wounded.  In the meantime, the 19th
Battalion was engaged in relieving the 31st in the
Canadian craters on the night of the 8th and 9th.
Lieut. Hooper (19th Batt.), the grenade officer of
the battalion, had undertaken the risky work of
reconnoitring the position in advance, and Majors
Moors and Morrison (19th Batt.) held this very
awkward bit of the line in succession.  The 19th,
in fact, like the 31st, could give very little active
assistance to the assaults, for their position in
Craters 6 and 7 was dominated by the German
Crater 5, and was exposed to heavy shelling.  The
main object was to hold their own, and this, it
may be said, they succeeded in doing.  Orders,
however, to retake the German positions were
peremptory, and, as each wave of assault recoiled
under the fire of the enemy, and because of the
impossible state of the ground underfoot, a new
one was promptly organised for the succeeding
night.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night, April 9th-10th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The attack on the night of the 9th was of a
extensive character, and achieved at least some
measure of success.  The 20th were brought up from
brigade reserve and thrown into a line between the
right of the 18th and the left of the 21st, and pushed
into action.  The main idea of the Higher Command
was a very sound one, if due allowance be made for
the extent of their knowledge.  The German craters,
then supposed to consist only of Craters 2 and 3,
were to be attacked simultaneously on three sides.
</p>

<p>
The 21st were to attack Crater 2 from their own
front and through Crater 1, taking their left in
reverse, and reoccupy the positions at Sackville
Centre and Fredericton Fort which had been held
by Capts. Gwynn and Meredith during the morning
of April 6th.  The 20th, to their left, were to attack
Crater 2 from the north-west.  The 18th, further to
the left of the line, were to attack Craters 2 and 3
from the north.  The 19th, continuing the line again
to the left, were to close in and assault the Germans
on their right flank, and so practically enclose them.
The first plan shows the position as it actually
was; the second as it was according to the
information of the Higher Command.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
Maps&mdash;Action on the night of April 9th to 10th 1916.
</p>

<p>
But here again all assaults from the north broke
down utterly.  The men simply could not get on,
and came staggering back into the line at dawn with
heavy casualties and in a state bordering on
collapse.  On the right, however, a glint of success
visited our standards.  It had been discovered on
the previous night that Crater 1 was not in the hands
of the enemy.  Lieut. Davidson (21st)&mdash;taking the
place of Capt. Miller who had been wounded in the
assault of the 8th&mdash;and Lieut. Brownlee once more
led a strong party of bombers from our trenches up
into Crater 1.  Seizing this, they charged into the old
German line about Fredericton Fort, where it had
been held during the German main attack by
Capt. Meredith and Capt Gwynn.  They took back this
lost ground and advanced north along the trench to
capture Crater 2 from behind.  This they failed to
do, but they established themselves close to its
south-west rim.  The ground won was retained and
consolidated, and the 2nd Division once more held much
the same position as it did on the morning of
April 6th.
</p>

<p>
Col. Wigle, of the 18th Battalion, had been in
charge of both these successive night attacks, and
his account of the failure of his own Battalion and
of the 20th to get on in this last attempt throws up
in high relief the difficulties confronting the
commanders in all these operations.  "They had no
proper information as to the ground in front of
them.  They could not find a guide to locate
Crater 3 at night&mdash;a heavy bombardment retarded
progress, and Lieut. Clarke reported that his party
could not get through.  The Brigade said the attack
must proceed.  The result of the operation brought
no change from the position of the previous night."
</p>

<p>
The 19th Battalion continued during this assault
to maintain the positions in the Canadian craters it
had taken over from the 31st Battalion on April 8th,
and continued to do so until its relief on the 12th,
Lieuts. Thomson and Macdonald commanding the
garrison of Crater 7, and Lieuts. Pepler and
Cassells of Crater 6.  An advanced machine-gun
emplacement in a very exposed position was held
by Privates D. C. Ballantine, A. W. Sharpe, and
W. Hull, for 70 hours without repose or relief.
There were many other notable examples of
gallantry in the regiment.  Cpl. A. F. Lynch went
out and dragged in a machine-gun, the entire crew
of which had been killed.  Private Hagan carried
Private Hoffman, who had been wounded in both
legs, to a place of safety 500 yards away through a
heavy artillery barrage.  Lance-Cpl. Bishop and
Private Schwann, D.C.M., carried food and water out
from the front trench to the garrisons of the craters,
who had been cut off from all supplies for 48 hours.
This act was done in broad daylight, when to move
was almost certain death.  The 19th did well.
</p>

<p>
Nor were the 20th, though less continuously
engaged, far behind them in their record of
individual heroism.  Lieut. C. A. Thomson helped to
dress the wounded men of his own and other
companies under heavy fire during the night attack of
April 9th-10th, though he himself was hit through
the leg by a rifle bullet.  He remained with his men
till dawn and then dragged himself back for first
aid&mdash;a journey which took four hours.  Private Cooke,
too, a stretcher-bearer, went on binding up the
wounded long after he was hit, and Private
B. Asquith carried a comrade to safety single-handed
under a heavy fire.
</p>

<p>
The Lewis gun team of the 20th, under Sergt. Simpson,
also exhibited marked courage and endurance.
They were under fire continuously from April
5th to 12th, held Crater 6 against an encircling
attack of German bombers, repulsed the attack, and
took three prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Wave upon wave of men had been thrust forward
in succession to retake the lost positions, yet as each
party came up it seemed to melt away in the noise,
squalor, and confusion of the front line.  The
telephones from behind were perpetually jangling with
the urgent messages from the Brigade, "You must
get on at any cost," and when the wires were cut in
spite of the heroic efforts of the regimental signallers
to make them good, runner after runner risked his
life in a dash across the shell-swept area with the
same pressing orders.  Urged on by their
commanders and their own indomitable spirit, the
regiments renewed the attack again and again.  But they
could not get on.  In the daylight the air was full
of flying steel, and the bright light showed the
assailants to their enemies so plainly that the lines of the
attackers withered away under that devastating hail.
By night the impenetrable darkness and the chaos of
earth and water enveloped each succeeding party
before they could get to grips with the enemy, in
the dark hours small parties were wandering round
trying to find their location in vain.  The survivors
returned almost fainting with exhaustion to the
nearest detachment they could find.  Some were left
behind as day broke, in the precarious shelter of
small holes.  Private Warn, of the 29th Battalion,
lived for nine days in such a position subsisting on
the rations and water-bottles taken from the bodies of
men of the 3rd British Division killed in the fighting
of the last days of March.  Marvellous to relate,
he rejoined his unit in safety after his long sojourn
with the dead.
</p>

<p>
The company officers had throughout behaved
with unflinching gallantry and vigour, nor had their
men failed in any way to second their continued
efforts.  Man had done his best, but he had been
defeated by Nature.
</p>

<p>
With this assault, then, ended the second phase
of the Battle of St. Eloi.  The first period had
witnessed the success of the German raid on the craters,
the second the repeated failure of the counter-attacks;
we now enter on the third phase, the
consolidation of the line which remained in our
hands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night, April 11th-12th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the night of the 11th began the relief of the
4th Brigade by the 5th; their casualties had been
14 officers and 389 men.[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
The whole action must be regarded as a counter-battle
fought under the worst possible circumstances.
The original advance of the 3rd British
Division over the shattered mine craters had met
with strong resistance and an unexpected concentration
of artillery fire, parallel to that of Verdun.  It
is probable that the enemy were already planning
an attack of their own.  They were, however, taken
by surprise and lost the first trick in the game.
Their reply was instant and effective.  Smashing
down the ruined trenches in front of them before
they could be made good by the defenders under a
deluge of high explosive they found a hole in the
line and seized the dominant position.  After this
coup, the weather and the guns combined to make
movement on either side almost impossible in a front
battered out of all recognition.  Had the Germans
known it, there were no front-line trenches worthy of
the name opposed to them at St. Eloi itself for days,
and even the second-line positions had been battered
to bits.  But, in fact, they could no more advance
than we could.  The barrage of our artillery
prevented, for them too, any heavy concentration behind
the craters, and they hung on desperately, as we
did, to the ground in their possession.  From the
beginning General Turner had formed a clear view
of the situation on which he based his operations.
From the infantry point of view the weakness
of the position was the extreme narrowness of
the front, which enabled the enemy's guns to
concentrate on a line the length of which was only
from 600 to 1,000 yards.  This made successful
movement impossible under fire, for there was no
cover for the massing of men preparatory to the
assault, and the small parties available were cut
down in a narrow area by the full weight of the
massed guns.  On the other hand, the weakness
from the point of view of the British and Canadian
gunners was the nearness of our lines to those of
the enemy and the uncertainty of all precise
locations.  This latter factor was terribly aggravated by
the mistake about Craters 4 and 5.  Two alternatives
then offered themselves.  The first was to
make a renewed assault on a far wider front from
Ruined Farm or beyond, on the left, to Piccadilly
Farm on the right, and so scatter the enemy's shell
fire.  The second was to get well back from the
craters and destroy their garrison by a concentrated
hail fire from the heavy guns.  It was not practicable
to adopt either of these courses, and it was
decided to reconstruct the old British line and to
hold fast to the two craters in our possession.
</p>

<p>
The work of reconstruction fell to the lot of the
5th Brigade under General Watson.  As has been
stated, on the night of April 11th the moves for
the relief of the 4th Brigade began and General
Watson took over the line in the early morning.
The front was for the moment comparatively quiet.
The 26th (New Brunswick) relieved the 19th on the
left, the 22nd (French Canadians) took over from
the 21st on the right, the 24th (Victoria Rifles)
relieved the 18th in the Centre Support position, while
the 25th (Nova Scotia) remained for the moment
in Brigade Reserve.  By April 13th the relief
was accomplished.  The position taken over by
General Watson consisted of the tenable trenches
and posts in the old British line, the Craters 6 and 7
and the advanced trenches in Crater 1, and Sackville
Centre and outposts to the north.  The task of
consolidating this last position fell to the 24th (Victoria
Rifles).
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night, April 14th-15th, 1916.</i>
</span>
Two very daring reconnaissances were made
on the night of the 14th-15th by Lieuts. Robertson
and Duclos, and by Lieut. Greenshields and Major
Ross, who was in charge of this particular part of
the line.  As a result, the position of the posts in
the old German trench leading into Crater 2 were
considerably strengthened and the approaches to
Crater 1 were heavily wired.  From this time on it
may be said that the ground recaptured on the night
of the 9th-10th by the 21st passed finally and firmly
into our hands.  Lieut. Vernon, of the Corps
Intelligence Staff, came down during the relief from the
Corps Commander to clear up the actual state of
affairs.  His report was of immense value, though it
failed to note the crucial error about the craters, and
confirmed the Higher Command in the view that the
first necessity was to remake a sound front line.
Nowhere, as Brig.-General Watson discovered, were
we anywhere as near the German positions as
previous reports had led us to imagine.  So deep was
the mud and slush that no patrols could move, and
the greatest difficulty was experienced in carrying up
materials for the repair of the line.  From the
trenches on the right to the trenches near Shelley
Farm, in the rear of our own craters was a gaping
void held precariously by a few isolated posts.  The
Brigade, however, set to work tenaciously to make
defences out of slush.  Basing itself on the line held
in the extreme left, it succeeded in re-establishing
a considerable part of the line in the direction of
the trenches on the right.  All this was done under
heavy fire, and the repairing of smashed-in parapets
occupied as much time as the preparation of the
renewed line.
</p>

<p>
Some author will yet arise to sing the epic of
digging.  It is of all work the most tedious and
dangerous; there is no glory in it; and an infinite
amount of labour and risk.  Yet the whole safety
of the line depends on the exertions of the digging
parties.  A well-kept line spells comfort and
security; a badly-kept one is a purgatory to its
occupants.  Every battalion and brigade looks
askance at the efforts of its predecessors, but none
the less rough justice is done in the common opinion
of the Army.  The 6th Brigade, at any rate, strove
valiantly; sandbags were placed in position, and
the front was at last protected by coils of barbed
wire.  In the meantime the position of our troops in
the advance craters had for some time been the
cause of serious anxiety.  Held in succession by
garrisons of the 31st, the 19th, and the 25th, throughout
the battle they had, except at rare intervals, been
cut off from communication with the main body.
Reliefs were accomplished by the dashes of the
parties in the dark; food and water got up by the
same method; and an occasional daring runner got
through by daylight, and carrier pigeons were for the
first time in the war employed as messengers.  The
orders were to hold on, but the value of the position
was most uncertain.  The two small craters lay in
advance of our trench well under the dominance of
German ground and of the rim of Crater 5.  They
were joined by a shallow communication trench,
along which it was only possible to crawl by daylight,
and the right-hand crater was in any case absolutely
untenable under artillery fire.  Forty yards away lay
the Germans, ready to pounce down on the garrison
at any moment of the day or night.  The defences
were negligible, and all attempts to improve them
permanently a failure.  No man stood upright
without the risk of a bullet through his brain.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night, April 14th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Germans, on the other hand, had, beside the
crater, a well-built trench made out of one of our
own support trenches dug on April 4th.  From this
they launched on the night of the 14th four
successive bombing attacks against the garrison.  All were
repulsed by bombers under the command of Lieut. Parish,
grenade officer of the 25th.  From this
point onward the action gradually merged into the
ordinary forms of trench warfare except for the
peculiar violence of the artillery.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 16th, 1916.</i>
</span>
On the 16th,
however, an event of great importance occurred.  The
gale died out, and the aeroplanes were able to soar
aloft once more.  The veil which had shrouded our
operations was at last lifted, and it was clear that
Craters 4 and 5 were in the hands of the Germans
and Craters 6 and 7 in those of the Canadians.  One
final effort was made by the enemy to capture the
Canadian craters, but the story of this will be told
in the following chapter.
</p>

<p>
It remains to sum up the action of St. Eloi as a
whole.
</p>

<p>
The 2nd Division was fighting upon historic
ground.  A few miles to the north lay the battlefield
of Ypres, which the 1st Division had made famous
in the eyes of the world; near by was Hill 60, from
which the 13th British Infantry Brigade had come to
the support of the Canadians during the crucial days
of April, 1915.  At St. Eloi itself, the Princess
Patricia's had, a year before, fought a long but
unsuccessful action.  It is therefore impossible to
avoid comparisons between the first and second
great actions of the Dominion Army.  To do so is
to refuse to accept the obvious.  The 1st Division
lost ground indeed under the gas attack and the
steady movement forward of massed Prussian Army
Corps.  They retreated, but under circumstances
which left them with a great and justified reputation.
To the 2nd Division was left the more bitter task
of fighting for a month under leaden skies above
and crumbling mud below, and yet failing to retain
their original positions.  But they deserved none the
less well of Canada.  What mortal man could do,
they did.  The Divisional Command was wise; the
Brigadiers thrust their commands forward with
unflinching resolution; the Battalion and Company
Commanders were both daring, resolute, and
prudent; the rank and file shouldered their tasks of
exhaustion and danger in a manner well worthy of
the best infantry in Europe.  It was not given to
the 2nd Division to take a part in one of those
glittering charges which figure so largely in Press
reports and so rarely in actions in the field.  Here
were no bayonets flashing in the sun, no shouts of a
triumphant infantry, but a long struggle against dirt
and darkness, the terror of the high explosive, and
the sharp spitting of the machine-guns.  It is easy
to think of war as one triumph reaching to another,
and the historians gloss over easily the failure of
their national arms.  This lesson is, perhaps, not
inapposite for a nation already proud in arms but
new in history.  Wherever in the long confines of
the Dominion there comes in the cool of the evening
the sense of irreparable loss for a treasured life,
let it be remembered that the men who died at
St. Eloi died no less nobly than the men who fell at
Ypres.  The lesson of failure is as much a part of
the education of a nation as that of success.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the meantime the position in the craters became
increasingly difficult as the days went on.  So grave
indeed was the situation that the Higher Command
was at one time seriously considering the plan of
abandoning them completely so as to give the
gunners freer play with the German positions
and attempt to blow them bodily out.  This
solution of the problem was ultimately rejected, and
the orders were to hold on at any cost.  As brigade
relieved brigade this was done in succession by the
31st, the 19th, 24th, 25th, and 26th&mdash;the last-named
regiment being still in Crater 6 on the morning of
April 18th.
</p>

<p>
Before proceeding, however, to the story of the
craters it may be as well to remind the reader, even
if a few facts must be repeated, of the precise
position of affairs.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night, April 11th-12th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the night of April 11th-12th, the 5th Brigade
carried out its relief of the 4th.  On the morning of
the 13th the position of the various regiments was
as follows:&mdash;The 22nd held our trenches on the
right, the 25th were in the centre, and the 26th on
the left and in the craters.  The 24th were in reserve.
Compared with the storm of battle which had been
raging, the times were comparatively quiet, except
for the occupants of the advanced post.
</p>

<p>
The rise to the knoll of St. Eloi is a gradual one,
but the slope of the ground now gave the Germans
the dominating position, and the very force of the
explosion of the mines had confirmed their
advantage.  Looking out from Craters 6 and 7 at night
the dimly-seen outlines of Craters 4 and 5 loomed
out on the sky-line overshadowing the minor
emplacements, which were in the hands of the
Canadians.  By day, from a distance of about
25 yards, it was possible for the enemy to see right
down into the cups of Craters 6 and 7 over the
flattened and crumbling edges, and no man moved
there save at the peril of his life.  The daylight
bombardments were fierce and intensive, for the
Germans had the range to a nicety with their trench
mortars.  The evenings were enlivened by periodical
bombing assaults from the higher ground.
Under these conditions the digging of a proper
defensive position could not be carried out, and in
this inferno the successive parties of the 5th Brigade
continued for five days.  One must picture the
garrison looking out in the darkness on a serrated ridge
illumined moment to moment by the light of star-shells
and wondering at what instant the hostile
rush would come.  Loneliness is a great feature
in war; and loneliness here was carried to its extreme.
The communication with the shattered defences of
the old front-line trenches in the rear was even by
night fitful and uncertain.  By day all touch over the
intervening ground of 40 yards was hopeless, except
now and again for a daring runner who took his life
in his hand's and usually lost it.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 15th, 1916.</i>
</span>
The carrier pigeons
were killed by shell-shock;[<a id="chap07fn1text"></a><a href="#chap07fn1">1</a>] the supply of food,
water and ammunition was precarious.  Many units
of the garrison went without any sleep, except the
doze of sheer exhaustion, for three or four nights on
end&mdash;for to sleep soundly might mean to wake to
instant death.  The ground underfoot was a morass
and the sky above charged with falling shell.  So
terrific was the bombardment that on one occasion
Crater 6 had to be abandoned chiefly owing to the
annihilation of its defenders.
</p>

<p>
Under these adverse circumstances the successive
regiments of the 5th Brigade held their ground with
the customary tenacity of Canadian infantry.  The
Germans with all their military virtues suffer from
one defect of imagination.  They can never believe
that small bodies of men, unsupported and beyond
the control of the Higher Command, will hold on
to untenable positions, or will remain fighting units
long after they have been beaten by all the rules of
war.  This error accounts for the failure to pursue
after the battle of Le Cateau, and the disregard of
the power of the British Army to "come again,"
which led to the fatal wheel of von Kluck; it
also accounts for the German neglect to push their
undoubted advantage at various stages of the first
and second battles of Ypres.  They could not
believe that men would resist so boldly who had
nothing in reserve.
</p>

<p>
On a lesser scale the position in the craters and
behind them was the same as in these historic
combats.  The reconstruction of the front or old
British line by the 5th Brigade was only beginning;
the second line was not in a satisfactory state; the
difficulty of bringing up more troops into the advance
positions was almost insuperable.  The Germans
had a chance, had they known it, of pushing through,
but the 5th Brigade held the fort until the
opportunity had long passed away.
</p>

<p>
The great concentration of reserves, the massed
attack delivered shoulder to shoulder with unflinching
courage in the face of a devastating fire, is familiar
to the Teutonic mind, which yet seems unable
to realise that the democracy of Great Britain,
France and Canada can produce men who can do
their military duty without the support of
carefully-arranged reserves.
</p>

<p>
As to the state of the craters and the line it may
be better to call independent witnesses.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 12th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
General Watson had made a tour of the whole
position on the morning of the 12th and reported
that the 21st Battalion were quite wrong in thinking
that in the attack of the 9th-10th they had got
anywhere near Crater 2.  They were, in fact, never
nearer than 70 yards to it.  This statement is
confirmed by all the evidence, though no doubt the
attackers were, in the dark and confusion, unable to
ascertain where they were.  The General also reported
that the first line, that is, the old British line
of trenches, was in a very battered state for defence.
He regarded the construction work on Crater 1,
described in the last chapter, as excellent, and this
must go to the credit of the 4th Brigade and the
21st and 24th Battalions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 12th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On April 12th Lieut. Vernon, of the Intelligence
Department, was sent down by the Corps Commander
to investigate the situation.  He failed to
penetrate the error between Craters 4 and 5 and 6
and 7, like everyone else, but his account of the
craters is of great interest in view of what followed.
</p>

<p>
"CRATER No. 7.&mdash;This is in our hands, and is a
shallow crater about forty yards across; the rims are
flat and not high and do not dominate the enemy's
new line as to elevation.  This crater has no
protection from enemy's fire except on the front side
(inside), no trenches or parados exist on the rear
(north) side, and this side is not occupied by our
troops, as it is constantly exposed to rifle and
machine-gun fire.
</p>

<p>
"The communication trench leading to this crater
from the north-east is now being improved (fifty
men, engineers, working during night), but as yet
affords only limited protection; its route includes
old mine craters and shell-holes.
</p>

<p>
"CRATER No. 6.&mdash;This is in our hands, and is
approached through Crater No. 7 by a ruined
shell-wrecked trench along which one has to crawl on
hands and knees, and it is constantly sniped at and
constantly under observation by enemy flares.
</p>

<p>
"The crater itself is deep, about forty yards across,
and affords much better protection than No. 7.  Its
rims are higher, but the Germans so dominate it
from their trench in front that our garrison has to
keep their heads down; the rims are constantly swept
by rifle and machine-gun fire.  It is built up with
some works on the inside facing the enemy, and
garrisoned by an officer, men, and machine-gun."
</p>

<p>
In the light of these facts it was decided to make
various arrangements for the improvement of the
defence&mdash;particularly for the linking-up of the
craters with the old British line by a communication
trench.  It proved impracticable, however, to carry
out the whole of the scheme, though 3,000 men were
turned on to the various works.
</p>

<p>
The Germans were in a comparatively enviable
position.  The lie of the ground was with them and
the protection afforded by their own craters
adequate.  Their knowledge of the precise state of
affairs was also more accurate, and in consequence
they were better served by their gunners.  They
possessed in addition the support trenches dug by
the 2nd Division on the nights of April 3rd/4th and
5th/6th.  They could use the trenches north of the
craters as the basis of their own new front line, and
the ones south as retiring points whenever our
artillery fire became unbearable.  None the less,
according to the accounts of prisoners, they suffered
severely, and the artillery barrage made it
impossible for them to bring up strong supports.  This
did not prevent them taking the offensive as soon
as our own counter-attacks had ceased.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Morning, April 14th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the 14th, as has been related,
they four times attempted to take the Canadian
Craters 6 and 7 by bombing assaults, but the 25th
Battalion repulsed them every time.  Simultaneously
an attempt was made to oust the garrison
of Crater 1.  The enemy to the number of 25
charged boldly across the open in broad daylight.
This position had, however, as related in the
previous chapter, been considerably strengthened, and
Lieut. Parish, the grenade officer of the 25th
Battalion, who took over the command on April 13th,
had extended the outpost line towards Crater 2,
and drove back the assailants without much difficulty,
but with considerable loss to them.  In fact,
our position in Crater 1 can never be said to have
been seriously threatened, for the ground gave the
Germans no special advantage.
</p>

<p>
At dawn on the 15th, the bombing assault on the
Craters 6 and 7 began again, this time preluded by
a hellish bombardment of trench mortars and heavy
guns.  Communication with the main position was
absolutely broken, and runner after runner failed
to get through.  Man after man was killed,
wounded, or driven back in the attempt.  The 25th,
however, maintained their position until they were
relieved by parties of the 24th on the following
day, when Lieut. Lamb took over Crater 7 and
Capt. Sutherland Crater 6.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>10.45, Night, April 15th, 1916.</i>
</span>
At 10.45 p.m. the
newcomers had to repulse a strong bombing
attack by the enemy.  Like others of the very
gallant men who held the advance posts, they
seem to have been of opinion that their
retention served no useful purpose and was in
fact impracticable, except at the cost of a
continuous drain of human life.  They speak of the
isolation of the position, of the dominating
outlook of the enemy, and of watching that enemy
improving his defences without any interference
from our guns while they themselves were
subjected to an almost continuous fire.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 16th, 1916.</i>
</span>
All this
is no doubt true&mdash;but it must be remembered
that on this day (the 16th) the aeroplanes for the
first time were able to soar into the heavens, and
look down on the real position of the earth.  Up to
this date, then, the Higher Command were informed
that we were holding essential positions right in the
heart of the enemy's line, and that every shell fired
by our guns would be a positive danger to the
Canadian garrison.  It was only as the weather grew calm
that the true facts of the case emerged.  In any case,
the Higher Command of the 2nd Division had no
cause to blame itself.  General Turner's information
from below had been incorrect; in spite of this lack
of knowledge his instinct for a practical situation,
innate in all real soldiers, had shown itself on every
occasion.  But the further we get from the front the
more difficult it is to arrive at truth, and the Corps
and Army Commanders are hardly to be blamed
if they were wrongly informed as to facts when
Company and Battalion Commanders in the firing
line were, with the utmost sincerity, reporting
that they occupied points which, as a matter
of fact, were never in their possession.  The
slope of the ground, as at Hooge and Zillebeke,
dominated the position; as soon as the Germans
held the mound and rise of St. Eloi their advantage
of sight was such that the free movements of troops
was impossible.  Intelligence could not be obtained,
and the co-ordination of the various units became
a matter of practical impossibility.  On the other
side of the ridge the Germans, screened from any
accurate artillery observation on their immediate
front, were able to move with comparative impunity.
The only answer was a counter-attack on a far more
extended area.
</p>

<p>
It is one of the fallacies of people who talk about
modern warfare to say that ground is nothing.  A
good trench, forty or fifty yards' fire zone, and sound
wire in front will no doubt protect resolute infantry
against a frontal attack.  But the whole movement
and massing of troops for such an attack, the supply
of provisions, ammunition and reliefs, the ordinary
workaday business which makes the existence of an
army possible, can hardly be carried out in the face
of an enemy who can watch every move on the board,
while the Higher Command can see practically
nothing of what is happening on the other side of
the hill.  It may be possible for troops to carry on
under these conditions, but it is neither usual nor

At noon on April 17th, the 24th Battalion was
relieved by the 26th; they had been twenty-four
hours in the advance post, the ordinary time for
anyone occupying a position of great stress and
danger.  The frequency of the relief speaks more
eloquently than words of the strain to which the
various garrisons had been subjected.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night, April 17th, 1916.</i>
</span>
The 26th
were in their turn relieved by the 29th Battalion
of the 6th Brigade on the night of April 18th/19th.
These latter troops had suffered severely during the
original fighting at St. Eloi; but as the other
brigades had done their turn in the trenches it was
imperative that the 6th Brigade should relieve them.

<p>
The next day the end came suddenly and the
defence collapsed.  Lieut. Myers, of the 29th
Battalion, with forty men was in occupation of the
left-hand Crater 6, and Lieut. Biggs, of the same
regiment, held Crater 7 on the right.  During the
morning all was quiet, but shortly after two o'clock the
enemy started an intense bombardment, which made
the craters practically untenable.  Very few men
remained alive or unwounded after three hours.
The shelling on the right-hand crater was particularly
severe, and some of the survivors got along the
shallow communication trench into Crater 6.  They
discovered, however, that their comrades were in
no better case than themselves.  The men were
buried over and over again, and the rifles, in spite
of their breech covers, finally refused to work.
When all resistance had been annihilated some forty
or fifty Germans started to come across.  As far as
can be ascertained, Lieut. Biggs appears to have
given permission to his few remaining and weaponless
men to surrender.  Lieut. Myers, who exhibited
a most indomitable spirit, resisted to the last, firing
one round from a discarded rifle and blazing off his
own revolver at the advancing enemy.  These were
the only shots left in the hands of the defence.
Finally, although already wounded, he suggested
to the remains of his command that they should
endeavour to retire across the fire-swept open country
rather than fall into German hands.  Five men, two
of them wounded, made this desperate attempt,
"and as the remainder," says Lieut. Myers, "seemed
disinclined to take the risk, I gave them my sanction
to surrender, as the Germans were then almost across
to the crater."  Of the five men and the officer, three
were wounded before they started, and only one
came in untouched; none the less, they succeeded in
making good their escape.  Of these, one was Private
Harding, who had come in from Crater 7, after
having his own brother and three other men killed
by his side.  They were the only survivors of the
garrison&mdash;the remainder being all killed or taken
prisoners.  It is, as a matter of fact, very difficult
to conceive and quite impossible to describe exactly
what the defenders of the craters had been through,
and it is wonderful that the men who escaped
retained their sanity.  Sergt. H. Bostel, of the 29th,
has, however, left such a clear and convincing record
of his experience that I prefer to use his own words
rather than to give it at second-hand.
</p>

<p>
"I was one of a party of 40 men under Lieut. Myers,
29th Battalion, and went forward to occupy
Crater 6 left at about 12 midnight April 18th.
We posted our sentries as soon as we got in and
relieved a party of the 29th Battalion under
Lieut. Ross.  During the morning everything was quiet
until about 2 p.m. when the enemy light
artillery&mdash;whizzbangs, and possibly minenwerfers were firing
on Crater 6 left, the one which we were in.  This
continued for about three-quarters of an hour,
during which time we had no casualties whatever,
There was no shelling for about one-quarter of an
hour, and then they opened up with heavy shells,
which fell just on the right front of the crater, and
afterwards got direct hits on the centre of the crater,
and in my section I had two killed and four
wounded.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>3:30 P.M., April 19th, 1916.</i>
</span>
This was about 3.30 p.m.  The heavy
shelling continued for about half an hour, but there
were no casualties, as my section took what cover
there was.  During the bombardment, Mr. Myers
was badly wounded.  He, however, gave orders that
immediately the bombardment ceased all men were
to 'man' the parapet.  The bombardment ceased
about 4.30 p.m.  We then finished dressing the
wounded.  Sergt. Slaughter went around detailing
men to posts and duties.  I remained with my
section of nine men.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>5:15 P.M., April 19th, 1916.</i>
</span>
It must have been about 5.15 p.m.
when they opened up again, as I remember Sergt. Slaughter
inquiring for me about 4.55 p.m. 'what
time it was, and if the rifles Were clean and
ready?'  I might have mentioned that during the
bombardment, Mr. Myers tried to get a message through by
pigeon, but they were killed by this bombardment.
The artillery then opened an intense bombardment
which was terrific.  Our wounded were killed in this
bombardment, being blown to pieces, and many men
were buried in their dug-outs.  It was impossible
for the remainder to render assistance, although
several attempts were made.  It was raining, and
water was flowing from the right crater to the left,
and it was practically impossible to move, as the
ground within the crater was like porridge except in
a few places.  During this bombardment we had
many casualties.  I saw personally eight men
knocked out by one large shell.  We half expected
that an attack would follow after this, and got as
many rifles posted as possible.  It was noticed
shortly after this that the Germans opened up rifle
fire from the trenches along the crater.  At the
same time the bombardment was continued.  The
fire of the German heavies now seemed to be
concentrated on our next crater.  Some men
came across from the right crater into the left
crater.  Sergt. Platt told me that the order had
been passed along saying that we were to close into
the left crater, as there appeared to be less shelling
in it.  The German rifle fire continued, and we
expected that at every moment they would come
across.  I discussed the question with Sergt. Slaughter
of sending back a message, to warn our
rear lines, but he said it was hopeless for any man
to try to get through that fire in time to be of any
assistance, and it was thought that it would be
impossible to bring reinforcements up to us in any
case.  Mr. Myers came out of his dug-out with his
wounds bandaged up and shouted out 'Come on,
boys; we will make a fight for it.'  We all came out
of our shelters.  I had been buried no less than
four times and the shells were splashing mud all
over the place.  We covered our rifles with
sandbags, but it was impossible to keep them in working
order, owing to the terrible state of the ground.
Sergt. Slaughter left me and went to his own
platoon.  I calculate that we had fifteen to twenty
men left.  By this time there were fifty or sixty
Germans coming across.  I should say there were three
rifles actually capable of firing, and these opened up.
Mr. Myers used his revolver and then seized a rifle,
but was only able to fire one round out of it.  I then
said to Mr. Myers: 'Are we going to make a fight
for it?' and he said 'Yes, boys.'  It appeared to us
that in the other crater the Germans had got up to
the remaining garrison and had overpowered them,
as I distinctly saw one or two men put up their
hands.  They were standing thigh deep in mud, and
it seemed absolutely hopeless for them to do
anything else but surrender.  I saw Mr. Biggs and three
or four of his men on the enemy's side of the crater.
All this time I might mention that the enemy had a
machine-gun playing right across the craters and his
artillery fire was extremely accurate on our side of
the craters where Mr. Myers and our party were.
Shortly after this we decided to retire, as we had no
means of putting up any resistance, and rather than
be taken prisoners decided to get back and give
information and ask for a counter-attack.  We then
started out with a party of three.  Mr. Myers was
wounded and had to be assisted, also Private
McDonald, who was wounded in the back and neck,
and a machine-gun man, I think named Whelan,
who was wounded in the face, joined us shortly after
we left, and later on one of the pigeon men overtook
us.  I do not know where he came from.  The
remainder of our small party in the craters must
have been killed or taken prisoners.  It was about
11 p.m. when we got back to Voormezeele, where
we left the wounded."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>April 20th, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The craters were thus lost.  The view that they
were untenable was obviously shared by the
Germans, who made no attempt to occupy them except
by way of roving patrols.  On the morning of the
20th Major Tait, of the 29th, and a small party
made a bold and complete reconnaissance of
Crater 6, which he found quite deserted.  "The
crater lips have been so knocked about that there
is no sign of any edge, and the whole is a mass of
slimy mud full of dead bodies."  On the same
evening Lieut. Jackson, of the 29th, took a patrol
over the abandoned ground and found it clear
except for a party of five Germans who made off as
soon as they were seen.  The opinion of the
regimental officers on the spot was, however, conclusive
against re-entering a position from which they had
literally been blown out, and their view was
accepted by the Higher Command, whose aeroplane
information enabled them to tell that the main crater
line had been lost on April 6th, and that the
retention of the small craters was merely an embarrassment
to our own gunners.  The position in Crater 1,
maintained throughout the fighting of the 19th,
remained definitely in our hands.
</p>

<p>
The story of the craters is like that of most of
the battle of St. Eloi, one of misfortune for the
2nd Division; but it is not one of blame.  The
successive regiments who held the outposts were
from the very outset at a great disadvantage
compared with their enemies.  They were not, and could
not be, properly supported by their own gunners
while the enemy's artillery was pounding them to
pieces.
</p>

<p>
They endured the horrors of this experience with
fortitude, and repelled the earlier assaults with
success.  But their defences were like a child's castle
on the sand, as wave after wave creeps up the shore
on an incoming tide.  The outlines became blurred
and faded under the remorseless gunfire, until the
final wave quietly and calmly swept the 29th out of
existence.  Of a garrison of eighty men one returned
unwounded.

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The fighting since March had, like the Canadians,
been moving steadily northward, from the trench
raiding opposite Messines and Wytschaete, through
the battle of St. Eloi in April, to the successive
actions at Sanctuary Wood and Hooge which I am
about to record.  These actions, which were in scale
if not in intensity the greatest of all the Canadian
battles, took place but a few miles away from that
field of Ypres which the First Division had rendered
immortal.  The dead who lie in their graves round
Langemark and St. Julien might well have stirred
in their sleep at the thunder of the Canadian guns.
Many men now quick and vigorous were to join them
in their last rest, falling in the same spot for the
same cause.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the first action was fought north-east of
Ypres, while the present struggle took place
south-east and much nearer to it.  Anyone who had
stood before the war on some high tower within the
circle of the vast mediæval ramparts of earth, which
have defied even modern artillery, and of the ancient
grey walls which still look out across the calm
waters of the broad moat and through the poplars
which fringe it, would have obtained an excellent
view of all save the outer edges of the field of
battle.  The Menin Road drives out over the flats
for a mile, and then for another mile up the gentle
slope to the ridge crowned by the ruins of Hooge.
This road marks the left and northern boundary of
the fighting with the exception of the bombing posts
running down to Bellewaarde Beek.  This ridge,
with one main gap and many irregularities, curves
round south-west and runs continuously to Mount
Sorrel, where the fighting stops on the south.  It
represents, as it were, the rim of a saucer of which
Ypres is in the central depression: and in war who
holds the rim holds the saucer.
</p>

<p>
Standing on such a position and casting his eye
along the ridge from Hooge, the observer sees
across a mile or so of green water-meadows striped
with the dark lines of high, luxuriant hedges, the
northern part covered only by a few isolated and
shattered trees, until he comes to Zouave Wood,
which runs up into the first and greatest of the gaps.
This gap isolates Hooge from the system, and
through it the Germans can see right down on to
the British trenches in the plain.  Farther south the
nearer slopes are covered with the great expanse
of Sanctuary Wood, once so thick as to be almost
impenetrable to the Guards in October, 1914, but
now sadly thinned by gun-fire, and crowned by the
slight eminences known as Hills 62 and 61.[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>]  Beyond
these comes Mount Sorrel, and the sector of
the action is complete; for here the British line
breaks suddenly back to the west and to the
railway.  But between Sanctuary Wood and Mount
Sorrel there is a curious feature&mdash;Observatory
Ridge&mdash;a long tongue of higher ground, bare
and barren, runs right back due west into the
British positions towards Zillebeke village and lake.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 1st, 1916.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Such was the position occupied by the Third
Canadian Division on June 1st, 1916, as seen
from the rear&mdash;a pleasant prospect if it were not
for the signs of devastation, the white-scarred,
headless trees, the upcast earth and the growl of the
guns which in the salient seem to come from every
point on the horizon.  Viewed by the Germans from
the east, it did not look quite so strong, for they too
held high ground dominating slightly in many
places the line held by the Canadians.
</p>

<p>
None the less it is a strong defensive position,
and Lord Ernest Hamilton in "The First Seven
Divisions" maintains with great show of reason that
it was always the natural place from which to protect
the town.
</p>

<p>
High ground may not possess to-day all the
importance it had in the warfare of past ages, but the
men on the hill still have one great advantage over
the men in the hollow: they can see and their enemy
is blind.  Every trench and every movement of
troops can be seen, and artillery fire can be directed
and observed with complete accuracy without
relying on aeroplanes and balloons, which are imperfect
substitutes for direct observation and which bad
weather may put out of commission.  Furthermore,
the life of the infantry in the plain becomes
intolerable when every head is liable to show and become
the target for immediate fire.  Life is too unpleasant
and death too prevalent.  The Canadian Corps,
then, had to hold the plateau at all costs.
</p>

<p>
This description of the ground may make it easier
to understand the positions occupied by the 3rd
Division and the 1st Division on its right&mdash;for the
2nd Division was still far away on its old ground
at St. Eloi, farther to the south, and was not called
up to help till a later stage of the action.
</p>

<p>
The left of the line was held by the 7th Brigade
under Brigadier-General A. C. Macdonell, and
the right by the 8th Brigade under Brigadier-General
Victor Williams.  Two companies of the
Royal Canadian Regiment, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel C. H. Hill, were firmly astride the
Menin Road towards the farther side of the
ruins of Hooge village.  Their left sloped down
through a series of bombing posts to Bellewaarde
Beek, where they linked with the 60th British
Brigade.  Their right extended to the gap, where
they were in touch with the Princess Patricia's
Canadian Light Infantry.  The trenches here had
been partially demolished, and an attempt was being
made to repair them at the time of the attack.  Next
to the right came the Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry, under Lieut.-Colonel Buller.
They had two companies in the front line, the
left-hand one on the slight rise on the northern boundary
of Sanctuary Wood, the right-hand one in another
gap or dip, so that the regiment had a depression
on either side of its position.  In the southern
section of Sanctuary Wood they met the line of the
1st Canadian Mounted Rifles of the 8th Brigade
under Lieut.-Colonel Shaw.[<a id="chap08fn2text"></a><a href="#chap08fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
This last battalion held Hills 62 and 61 with
three companies in the firing line and one just
behind, but its junction with the Princess Patricia's
was slightly broken at the dip.  Next on the right
came the 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles Battalion
under Colonel Ussher, with three companies in the
firing line holding Mount Sorrel.  Two platoons
were just in rear in the support trenches and in the
communication trench leading to Headquarters.
Here the 8th Brigade ended and the 2nd Brigade
of the 1st Division took on the line.
</p>

<p>
Behind this front line there was a support line on
the left of the position.  From the Menin Road the
strong and excellent support line trenches drive
south-east.  This line was held by the support
company of the Royal Canadian Regiment and the
support company of the Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry, each backing their respective
regiments in the front trenches.  At a point north-east
of Maple Copse and in the middle of Sanctuary
Wood this well-marked support line ceased and
broke into two separate systems of trenches.  In
the first place a series of communication trenches
broke back sharply to Maple Copse and the
south-west, making an acute angle, or Apex, facing the
Germans.  From this Apex the support line
continued, though not at all points in a fully completed
condition, close behind our front-line trenches on
Hill 62 and Mount Sorrel.[<a id="chap08fn3text"></a><a href="#chap08fn3">3</a>]  Behind these again
was a series of Fortified Posts covering, in a
somewhat irregular pattern, the ground between Zouave
Wood and the southern slopes of Observatory
Ridge.  This in effect completed the system of
front line and support defence.  Further back, a
second line nearer Ypres, known, as the G.H.Q. trenches,
represented the last barrier.  It will be
observed that there was no trench between Maple
Copse and Square Wood.
</p>

<p>
The Fortified Posts on the north were held by the
support battalion, the 5th Canadian Mounted Rifles,
under Lieut.-Colonel Baker, and on the south were
in possession of the spare platoons of the 4th
Canadian Mounted Rifles and were in rear of their lines.
One fort, however, was in the hands of the Princess
Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry.  Maple Copse
was occupied by a company and a half of the 5th
Canadian Mounted Rifles, and the remainder of the
latter were back in reserve.  With them were the
42nd Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada)
under Lieut.-Colonel Cantlie in support of the 7th
Brigade, and also the remaining company of the
Royal Canadian Regiment.  A glance at the map
will make the positions of the various units and the
general scheme of defence clear, and tiring as such
a recapitulation of companies and regiments may
be, it is necessary if the story is to be in the least
intelligible.  The 49th (Edmonton Regiment),
under Lieut.-Colonel Griesbach, was the reserve
battalion of the 7th Brigade, and the 2nd Canadian
Mounted Rifles of the 8th.  The 9th Brigade was
in Divisional Reserve.

<br />
Map&mdash;Sanctuary Wood area. POSITION BEFORE ATTACK ON JUNE 2ND 1916
</p>

<p>
Such were the dispositions of the corps, now
under Gen. Sir Julian Byng, who had on May 28th
succeeded Gen. Alderson, when the storm finally
broke.[<a id="chap08fn4text"></a><a href="#chap08fn4">4</a>]  There had been warnings already.  The
enemy had been driving "T" saps[<a id="chap08fn5text"></a><a href="#chap08fn5">5</a>] out in front
of their lines and linking them up so as to form
a new trench in advance of the old one.
Lieut.-Colonel Odlum, of the 7th (British Columbia)
Battalion, launched a daring plan of counter
construction at one place against the works and
definitely checked their progress.  The shelling of
the last few days before the attack had been
peculiarly heavy, and it is probable that the Higher
Command had other information of impending
mischief.  It was undoubtedly this fact which
induced Major-General Mercer and Brigadier-General
Williams to make their tour of the trenches
on that fateful early morning of June.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, early morning.</i>
</span>
They left at
six in the morning and reached the Battalion
Headquarters of the 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles before
eight o'clock.  General Mercer was accompanied by
his A.D.C., Lieut. Gooderham, and General
Williams by Capt. Fraser, the Brigade Orderly Officer.
Colonel Ussher conducted them up the communication
trench at about a quarter past eight, and the
party had either reached the front trench or was
about to enter it when with a sudden crash the
enemy's guns opened.
</p>

<p>
The 3rd Division was now to experience in its
full fury the artillery preparation of the summer of
1916.  All that had gone before was as nothing to
this.  The bombardment of 1915 had been feeble in
comparison, and those of 1914 a mere sun-shower
as compared to tropical rain.  The soldiers of the
1st Division when they landed in France had, with
their native humour, come to laugh at the Jack
Johnsons from the 11-inch howitzers, though these
were formidable to an army which then had no guns
of an equal range.  But a preparation in the modern
style leaves very few remaining to laugh.  The
2nd Division had a taste of the new shelling at
St. Eloi and its dangers had been intensified by a bad
position and wretched trenches.  But even so, all
agreed that there was no comparison between the
gun-fire of April and of June, which was the heaviest
endured by British troops up to that time.  The
Germans were directing their efforts against a strong
position and sound trenches, yet they swept both out
of existence as the autumn wheat is mowed down
by the reaper.  It was not merely a line they
destroyed, but a whole area.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, 8.30 A.M.-1.15 P.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the storm which burst on the 3rd Division
at 8.30 that June morning was like a tropical tornado
which presses men flat to the ground and suffocates
them with the mere force of the wind, which uproots
forests and hurls them headlong, obliterates all
ancient landmarks and the houses and shelters of
men and beasts, and leaves behind nothing but a
tangled desolation from which a few survivors creep
out scarcely sane enough to realise the catastrophe
or to attempt to repair the damage.  But here the
blinding crashes overhead were not those of thunder
and lightning, but of high explosive.  The fragments
which drove through the air were not bits
of wood or masses of vegetation.  They were steel
and iron fragments which pierced the flesh, as the
shock of the explosion stopped the heart and threw
cascades of earth over bodies in which life still beat
feebly or in which it was already extinct.  The
solid trenches melted away, and mounds and craters
appeared where none existed before.  A litter of
broken wood, burst sandbags, and human remains
cumbered the earth where it was not merciful enough
to bury them.  And this tornado of man was let
loose on a few acres which contained, perhaps, two
or three thousand troops, and continued for the
space of about four hours.
</p>

<p>
At the end, although the awful noise goes on,
the shower of steel ceases.  The guns have lifted
to the second line.  Here and there groups of
survivors creep out, wild-eyed or stupefied, like men
just risen from the tomb, to see the solid lines of the
enemy advancing at a walk or a jog-trot.  Every
man acts according to his instinct.  A few lie where
they are and chance being taken prisoners.  Some
make a rush and crawl for the ruined communication
trenches and face the barrage once more in the hope
of rejoining their comrades.  Another group resists
desperately, grasping what rude and broken weapons
remain to it, and dies in a hopeless struggle.  Such
in effect is the story of the front and support line
companies of the 1st and 4th Canadian Mounted
Rifles and the right-hand company of the Princess
Patricia's between 8.30 and 1.15 of June 2nd, as
their casualties will prove.  That story must,
however, be told in greater detail; but isolated facts
cannot be understood without their environment.
</p>

<p>
The Generals and their Staffs were caught by the
outbreak of this Inferno.  It is idle to go into the
question as to exactly how, when, and where the
Divisional General died.  There are many ways
into such a controversy and no way out.  All that
is certain is that one of the first shells burst close
to the Staff, wounding Brigadier-General Williams[<a id="chap08fn6text"></a><a href="#chap08fn6">6</a>]
and stunning Major-General Mercer.  None the
less, shortly afterwards General Mercer sent back
a message, the last to come through from Mount
Sorrel, asking for the howitzers to be turned on.
After that he tried to get back to his post behind
the lines and failed.  Some say he remained with
the 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles Battalion for a
time and was seen moving up and down.  Soon,
at any rate, he was seen no more by living men.
He must have made another attempt to get back
to his post and been killed on the way.  His body
was found with three wounds on it in Armagh Wood.
He was buried at Poperinghe.  There lie the mortal
remains of Lieut.-Colonel Hart-McHarg and
Lieut.-Colonel Birchall, who served under him in the 4th
Battalion of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division.
It is tragic to think that such a brilliant soldier, who
had risen to the command of a division by sheer
force of ability, should have died just as his new
command was going into its first big action and
needed his services so greatly.
</p>

<p>
The trenches of the 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles
and their garrisons thus vanished, and nothing more
was heard of them save for the stories of small
isolated parties which escaped.  The last trench on
the right and round the western bend of the salient
escaped a little more lightly.  The garrison held
on till night fell, and then the survivors, finding
the Germans coming up behind them in Armagh
Wood, made good their escape to the lines of the
2nd Brigade on their right.  Colonel Ussher collected
some of the support company in a roofed-in trench,
hoping to keep them under cover there until the
German attack.  Almost immediately heavy shells
blocked both ends of the tunnel and many were
stifled before the party could break out of this living
grave.  This was the last attempt at any organised
resistance.  Major Dennison fought a rearguard
action at point-blank range with the advancing
Germans, and eventually got back into the second
line with five men.  Meanwhile, the shelling on the
support line had been almost equally intense.  The
Fortified Posts held by the 4th Canadian Mounted
Rifles were blown to pieces and the platoons in
them.  One garrison perished and of the second
garrison three men got away.  In all some thirty
or forty men of the 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles
got away and were rallied behind the support line.
Their casualties were 637; the regiment had simply
ceased to exist.[<a id="chap08fn7text"></a><a href="#chap08fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
On their left the 1st Canadian Mounted Rifles
Battalion had fared little better.  All through the
morning, their advance and support trenches being
flattened out section by section, the survivors rallied
in isolated groups wherever cover was left.  In face
of the attack these retired, some on the trenches
in the Apex, and some on the Battalion Headquarters,
where Colonel Shaw and the support
company were preparing to put up a vigorous resistance.
The casualties of the front companies speak
for themselves.  Of one company fifteen came out
alive, of the second company fifteen, of the third
twenty-three.

<p>
The German assault was delivered just after one
o'clock, when their guns lifted from the front
trenches and was preluded by the blowing up
of mines, which were, however, outside our
trenches and had no effect on the ultimate issue.
The attack was launched from the south-west,
for it was plainly visible to our men in the
trenches by Hill 60.  The watchers saw in the
clear air four successive lines of grey-clad figures
carrying packs and greatcoats advancing in the
distance with the assurance of those who neither
dread nor expect resistance; behind came the
engineers with the material to make good the position.
An indignant rapping from the machine-guns on
Hill 60 greeted them; but the tide flowed on,
unheeding.  The lines reached Mount Sorrel and
disappeared.  The enemy, by attacking the corner of
the line, advanced in effect "en échelon"&mdash;that is
to say, their left flank reached Mount Sorrel and
cleared it somewhat before their centre attacked the
1st Canadian Mounted Rifles.  The result was that
Colonel Shaw in his redoubt found his right flank
exposed and was the object of a concentric attack.
None the less, the garrison put up a heroic fight
against machine-guns, rifle-fire, and grenades.
Colonel Shaw fell, and with him Major Palmer and
his Adjutant, Lieutenant Rowles.  Finally, when
all the officers but two and most of the N.C.O.'s
were killed or wounded, and the position was in
danger of being surrounded, Lieuts. Key and Evans
led the fifteen survivors back into a Fortified Post
just in front of the Apex, where they collected
some stragglers from other units and held on until
relieved the following day.  This dogged defence
was of the utmost value, for the second line at this
point was desperately weak and quite unable to
resist a resolute assault.[<a id="chap08fn8text"></a><a href="#chap08fn8">8</a>]  Of the support company
and Battalion Headquarters about seventy-one men
survived.  The total casualties of the regiment were
367.  It was now the turn of the Princess Patricia's
to withstand the assault, which came upon them at
about 1.30 p.m.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, 1.30 P.M.</i>

</p>

<p>
Regiments which possess some special name as
opposed to ordinary battalions, which are designated
by numbers, and which are therefore picked out by
over-zealous correspondents for particular praise
for their share of work which all have done equally,
are not always popular.  This is certainly the case
in the Imperial service; and yet no Line regiment
would grudge the Guards their reputation, for what
they have won in praise they have earned, and they
have worn their laurels with a studious modesty.
</p>

<p>
The Princess Patricia's had two companies in the
firing line, one in the communication trench leading
up to it past Battalion Headquarters with a tail in
the support line, and a fourth entirely in the support
line trenches.  The right-hand company in the firing
line was, like the Canadian Mounted Rifle Regiments,
blown out of its trenches, and the survivors
took ground in communication trenches held by the
support company.  At 1.30 p.m. the German wave
lapped round the left of all except the front-line
company commanded by Captain Niven, which
turned about and volleyed into the Germans' right
rear.
</p>

<p>
This company kept its position in the front line
and maintained it for eighteen hours after the
bombardment began, although the enemy attempted
to penetrate the gap on the left and had
seized the dip to the right of the trenches on
the rise which they held.  Capt. Niven had with
one hand to fend off attempts to bomb his men at
right and left down the trench, and with the other to
turn and enfilade with excellent result the Germans
who were pressing in on either flank.  Yet he, who was
in command, is chiefly anxious to explain in his report
that this was the result of a pure accident, as the
enemy had over-ranged his trench and the heavies
and trench mortars were bursting twenty yards
behind, save for the right platoon, which mustered
only three survivors.  The enemy then attacked the
Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry
companies in the communication trenches and began to
bomb his way to the support line and the Apex line,
which possessed at that time scarcely any defenders.
Colonel Buller rallied the support platoons in the
communication trench and pushed them up to a
counter-attack to save the support line.  Not
satisfied with the rate of their progress through the
shattered trench, he climbed outside to urge them
on, and was killed instantly.[<a id="chap08fn9text"></a><a href="#chap08fn9">9</a>]  He possessed one of
those fearless and impetuous natures which made
him the fitting commander of a famous regiment and
brought him the soldier's death he would have
desired.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, 2 P.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
There followed a dark and bloody <i>mêlée</i> between
the Germans and the Canadians in the communication
trenches, the former trying to press on and rush
the support line and the latter trying to build blocks
down the communication trenches to stave them off
until that line could be fully manned.  At one time
the Princess Patricia's in the communication trench,
though attacked across the open simultaneously on
both sides, resisted the enemy, thus emulating the
traditions of the famous British regiment which,
when attacked from behind, simply turned its rear
rank about and fired in both directions.[<a id="chap08fn10text"></a><a href="#chap08fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
Major Critchley, Staff Captain of the 7th Infantry
Brigade, going up after we had retaken the
communication trenches, said that he found the bodies
of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry
lying in succession behind six blocks in the trench,
showing that in their retirement they had held each
block until a new one was built.  In effect, the
garrison of each block had perished while the new
one behind was being built.  The losses were, of
course, very severe, but in the meantime the reserve
company of the regiment had come up into the
support line behind, and the vital position was
saved; for if the support line had gone, the whole
of the Ypres salient would at that hour in the day
have gone with it, as the subsequent argument
will show.  Colonel Buller and his men held the
fort at the critical hour, and gave Brigadier-General
Macdonell time to bring up his reserves.[<a id="chap08fn11text"></a><a href="#chap08fn11">11</a>]
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, Captain Niven, some hundred
yards to the north-west, was still clinging to the knoll
of trenches in the front line amid an encircling tide
of Germans.  As has been already stated, his
right-hand platoon had been destroyed by the
bombardment and Lieut. Hagerty, its commander, killed.
Lieut. Molson then took charge, and with great
gallantry dug out some of the men buried alive,
although the trench was ranged to a nicety.  He was
shot through the jaw, and the section was abandoned
in the end.  Lieut. Triggs, in the nearest sector,
was severely wounded soon afterwards, and Lieut. Irwin,
the only remaining subaltern, was hit later on
in the day.  Captain Niven, though hit himself,
continued to command and move about, as he was by
this time the only remaining officer of his company.
The telephone dug-out was smashed in and all
communication with the battalion lost.  None the less,
two heroic runners managed to get through and to
report that the company were still holding out.
Some of the worst cases of wounded were even
carried back by the stretcher-bearers under an
appalling fire to the support line.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, 9 P.M.</i>
</span>
At dusk
Lieut. Glascoe was sent up from Battalion Headquarters,
and Captain Niven handed over his command and
attempted to go back and report to Battalion
Headquarters.  In the course of his wanderings he
came to a dressing station, and, after his wound
had been dressed, started once more for his isolated
company, which after eighteen hours was still left
among the encircling Germans as lonely as the
survivors of the Flood on Mount Ararat.  He was
promptly hit again in the breast.
</p>

<p>
At 2.30 a.m. of the 3rd Lieut. Glascoe, seeing
that the whole surviving party would shortly be
completely surrounded, exercised a wise discretion and
got his remnant safely back to the support line.
"During the bombardment," says Captain Niven,
who certainly has a right to be heard, "this company
behaved splendidly, every man holding his own and
inflicting heavy losses on the enemy wherever the
opportunity occurred."[<a id="chap08fn12text"></a><a href="#chap08fn12">12</a>]
</p>

<p>
It was during the general retirement from the
east of Sanctuary Wood that two of our guns were
lost.  Those guns were 18-pounders, and had been
brought up to within 400 yards of the front line and
established in gun-pits.  They were to be used only
in case of emergency, as their fire would be sure
to disclose their position to the enemy.  Owing to
their position and purpose they were known as
"sacrifice guns."  Lieut. C. P. Cotton, of the
1st Divisional Artillery, was in command of
them.
</p>

<p>
A German aeroplane found these guns on Friday
morning (June 2nd), and particular attention was
immediately paid to them in the midst of the general
bombardment of our trenches and positions.
Lieut. Cotton's gun-crews suffered, and he reinforced
them with Sappers James E. Hood and Chambers,
who were in charge of an emergency
wireless station situated within a few yards of the
gun-pits.
</p>

<p>
Cotton opened fire at 1.45 in the afternoon, and,
assisted by his three surviving gunners and the two
sappers, continued to fire until the enemy came over
Observatory Ridge to within a few yards of the
gun-pits.  He then ordered a retirement.  Sapper
Hood rushed into his wireless dug-out, destroyed
his instrument, and then escaped with a bullet
through the bone of his arm.  Lieut. Cotton and the
others of the gun-crews were not so fortunate.  They
died near the gun-pits&mdash;they and their guns having
served their desperate purpose to the end&mdash;and so
they too made the great sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
The attack still continued to spread up to our left.
Between two and three o'clock in the afternoon the
extreme German right had come up to assault our
extreme left at Hooge.  Two attacks were however,
repulsed with great loss to the enemy by the
Royal Canadian Regiment.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, 2 P.M.-3 P.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
None the less, the position at three o'clock was one
of the very gravest danger.  On a frontage of three
battalions the Germans had overwhelmed our front
and right support lines on the crest of the ridge and
annihilated or decimated the defending regiments.
From Maple Copse they could be seen advancing
in strong force on the high ground of Observatory
Ridge into the very heart of our position, and they
were also attacking farther north down the various
communication trenches which led to the support
line.[<a id="chap08fn13text"></a><a href="#chap08fn13">13</a>]  Our left at Hooge had held firm, but it was
now utterly in the air, save for Captain Niven and
his men, and the triumphant enemy were rapidly
sweeping behind that line of defence.  The support
trenches having been taken on Hill 62 and Mount
Sorrel, there was nothing in front of the German left
and centre except the Apex line to Maple Copse.
It was, therefore, a matter of life and death to hold
on to these left-hand support trenches to the Apex
and to Maple Copse.  But the line was very weakly
held for the task of resisting 2,000 Germans
attacking from higher ground and flushed with victory.
There were, in fact, about three companies of the
5th Canadian Mounted Rifles, the remains of the
1st and 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles, perhaps a
hundred all told, and what was left of three
companies of the Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry.  The situation looked so dangerous
that the famous colours of the Princess Patricia's
were entrusted to Lieut. Scott, who took them back
to Brigade Headquarters to avoid any possibility
of their capture.  To the left, from Zouave Wood
to Menin Road, was one company of the Royal
Canadian Regiment in support of their companies
in the front line trenches, who could not abandon
their ground.  In addition, the Staffs of the 3rd
Division and the 8th Brigade, who were primarily
concerned, had lost their commanding officers.
From Mount Sorrel and the 4th Canadian Mounted
Rifles they had had no news since 9.15 a.m., and did
not know whether General Mercer and General
Williams were alive or dead, or whether the trenches
there still held.  On the other hand, the 1st
Canadian Mounted Rifles had continued to report till
just before the German attack at 1.15 p.m. that they
were holding their ground and were in no need of
reinforcements.  None the less, at noon the 2nd
Canadian Mounted Rifles were moved up from
Brigade Reserve to Zillebeke under heavy barrage fire.
</p>

<p>
The three factors which prevented a serious
disaster were undoubtedly the hesitation of the enemy
to pursue an advantage, the strenuous resistance of
the 5th Canadian Mounted Rifles under Colonel
Baker, and the energetic action of General
Macdonell of the 7th Brigade in taking advantage of
the precious moments of delay and pushing every
man he could command, beg or borrow into the
threatened section.[<a id="chap08fn14text"></a><a href="#chap08fn14">14</a>]
</p>

<p>
The Germans at Le Cateau, and at the first and
second battles of Ypres, had always stopped just
when victory seemed within their grasp.  Nor on
this occasion were they wanting to themselves.
There are, however, no doubt explanations.  One
was in a document found on the body of a German
officer which laid down precisely the position they
were to occupy and entrench, and this they had
attained except in the neighbourhood of Rudkin
House.[<a id="chap08fn15text"></a><a href="#chap08fn15">15</a>]  Our barrage was heavy behind them, and
it was not until 9 p.m. that they were reinforced by
an additional two thousand men in spite of our
heavy artillery.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, afternoon and evening.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
By two o'clock the right of the 7th Brigade was
in grave peril.  The Brigadier at once ordered up
the reserve company of the Royal Canadian Regiment
to help.  Already ten minutes before he had
sent up two companies of his support battalion, the
42nd, to assist the hard-pressed 5th Canadian
Mounted Rifles in Maple Copse and beyond.
These two companies undoubtedly just saved the
situation, and a delay of an hour or so in dispatching
them might have proved fatal.  The remaining two
companies of the 42nd, which were back in Ypres
and beyond, were ordered to come up to the support
line trenches.  The 49th (Edmonton) Battalion
(Col. Griesbach), which was right back in Brigade
Reserve, was ordered up to the Ypres ramparts, and
reached there about 8.30 p.m.  Not content with
this, at 3 p.m. the Brigadier asked General Butler,
of the 60th British Brigade, on his left, to lend him
a couple of companies to help hold the support line.
The request was granted, and two companies of the
King's Royal Rifles took up the left-hand section,
south of the Menin Road, thus enabling the Royal
Canadian Regiment Companies to shift farther to
their right and strengthen the critical point of
resistance at the Apex.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, 5 P.M.-6 P.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
By 5 or 6 p.m. General Macdonell had got into
the support line and Apex line five entirely fresh
companies&mdash;a welcome relief to the nerve-worn and
shattered units which, under the most tremendous
shell-fire, had been struggling there from eight in
the morning against heavy odds.  He had also the
49th well up in reserve, while the 8th Brigade had
three companies of the 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifles
up on the right of the 5th Canadian Mounted Rifles
in Maple Copse in the communication trench
running back in the direction of Zillebeke.  The
reinforcements thus amounted to eight fresh companies
or two battalions.  It is impossible to speak too
highly of the resource, vigour, and moral courage of
the General, who took the situation in charge on his
own initiative, or of the dash of the men who came
up through the barrage over flat ground, every yard
of which could be seen by the enemy.
</p>

<p>
For the Brigade and Divisional Staffs the period
was one of doubt and anxiety.  Information was
hard to get from the front, and what news came in
was generally bad.  Between five and six in the
evening General Hoare Nairne, C.R.A.[<a id="chap08fn16text"></a><a href="#chap08fn16">16</a>] took
command of the 3rd Division, and Lieut.-Colonel Bott,
2nd Canadian Mounted Rifles, of the 8th Brigade.[<a id="chap08fn17text"></a><a href="#chap08fn17">17</a>]  But
to the units hastily gathered under Lieut. Evans
in the Fortified Post, to the Princess Patricia's
Canadian Light Infantry, and the 5th Canadian Mounted
Rifles, the strain was well-nigh intolerable, for the
shelling on the support line had been almost as
intense as that on the first line.  The 5th Canadian
Mounted Rifles were nearly blown out of Maple
Copse, and had to shift from trench to trench more
than once as the Germans got the range, but they
held on.  On the left the enemy had in no way
abandoned his intention of getting into our support
line, and about 2.30 p.m. some forty succeeded in
rushing it.[<a id="chap08fn18text"></a><a href="#chap08fn18">18</a>]  There was a sharp, short hand-to-hand
struggle, in which the Princess Patricia's bayoneted
the lot.  The occupants of the Fortified Post at Maple
Copse were annihilated by shell-fire, and Maple
Copse, held by the 5th Canadian Mounted Rifles,
was so heavily shelled that the whole wood was
smashed flat.  They had to make new trenches, as
the old ones became untenable.  This was done
under the eyes and fire of the enemy, who loomed
over them on Observatory Ridge in unknown
numbers and from invisible positions.
</p>

<p>
Major Hugh Walkem arrived with the first relief&mdash;a
company of the 42nd&mdash;about 2 p.m., and finally
got into position in the Apex between the
Canadian Mounted Rifles and the Princess Patricia's.
The other company of the 42nd took up a place
in the support trenches.[<a id="chap08fn19text"></a><a href="#chap08fn19">19</a>]
</p>

<p>
Through all this period there were constant
rumours, fortunately untrue, that the Germans had
penetrated the line at one point or another.  It was
here that Sergeant Jones, 42nd (Royal Highlanders
of Canada), made a peculiarly daring reconnaissance,
lying out all night within thirty yards of the enemy
and observing the line of their digging and the
direction of their fire.
</p>

<p>
In the meanwhile, the 2nd Canadian Infantry
Brigade on the right was also in a position of
grave peril, for the enemy in Armagh Wood were
practically behind its left rear.  At 2 p.m. they
were already in Armagh House, but were chased
out by a patrol of the 5th Battalion under Captain
Collum.  The only course left open to the 5th
Battalion (Western Cavalry), which held the line here,
was to throw its left out at right angles to its main
line of trenches along a communication, and not a
firing, trench in the direction of Square Wood, and
to establish themselves firmly in the wood itself.
This they did, and remained till evening watching
the movements of the enemy, who were entrenching
themselves firmly on the ridge just behind Rudkin
House.  To the north the Canadian Mounted
Rifles were in Maple Copse 600 yards away, but the
ground between was fire-swept and trenchless.
In the meantime, the 7th Battalion (British
Columbia) was brought up to support the 5th
Battalion (Western Cavalry).  The 2nd Brigade
offered to make a counter-attack in the course of the
afternoon with the ten platoons available in this
line, but the offer was rejected by the 1st Division,
which considered, rightly enough, that the force was
insufficient for so long a frontage.  The Germans,
therefore, remained undisturbed.  None the less, the
Brigade was warned that a counter-attack would
almost certainly be made as soon as sufficient
reserves came up.
</p>

<p>
One counter-attack of a minor character was
attempted from the Maple Copse side of the
trenchless area by the 3rd Division.  The 2nd
Canadian Mounted Rifles, three companies strong,
had arrived in the trenches in front of Zillebeke
at 6 p.m.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, 6 P.M.</i>
</span>
They linked up with the 7th Battalion
of the 2nd Brigade on the right, who had come up
to support the 5th Battalion of their Brigade, and
attempted to create out of the old trenches there a
third line in case the enemy should break through.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, 9 P.M.</i>
</span>
Finally, as dusk drew on, two companies of the 2nd
Canadian Mounted Rifles were ordered forward to
Maple Copse to attempt a counter-attack on the
enemy at Rudkin House.  It was eleven o'clock when
they reached the Copse and met Major Allen, of
the 2nd C.M.R.'s.  Colonel Baker had just fallen
mortally wounded while walking up and down
behind a new trench his men were digging under
heavy fire and encouraging them by his coolness
and example.[<a id="chap08fn20text"></a><a href="#chap08fn20">20</a>]
</p>

Map&mdash;Sanctuary Wood&mdash;POSITION AFTER THE ATTACK JUNE 2nd 1916
</p>

<p>
The 5th Canadian Mounted Rifles succeeded in
maintaining their position in Maple Copse.  Shelled
to pieces for hour after hour, and hunted from cover
to cover, they yet held on, and this fact was in no
small measure due to the great firmness and heroic
disregard of death exhibited by Colonel Baker.  He
inspired his men by sheer personal magnetism and
by the example of a splendid devotion to duty.
Other men did their share in saving the line; still,
but for him it might not have been saved at all,
and in that case June the 2nd would have been
associated with a great disaster to our arms.
</p>

<p>
The attack of two companies of the 2nd C.M.R.'s
in the dark against an unknown German position
held by troops whose numbers it was impossible to
estimate was not a very promising venture, and it was
not pressed home, the attackers being set to the more
feasible task of trying to dig a trench linking up
Square Wood and Maple Copse.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, 11 P.M.</i>
</span>
The Battalion
sustained very heavy losses.  This attempt likewise
failed, the shell-fire in the open proving too heavy;
but Captain Leduc, of the 2nd Canadian Mounted
Rifles, advanced with great daring as far as Rudkin
House and satisfied himself&mdash;as proved to be the
case&mdash;that the enemy's new line was being built well
behind it.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, midnight.</i>
</span>
The 8th Brigade had by now suffered
between 1,800 and 1,900 casualties out of their total
strength, and it was time for some fresh troops to
take a hand in the game.
</p>

<p>
The losses, indeed, in both the 7th and 8th
Brigades had been heavy, but the support line, in
spite of its extraordinary zigzag conformation and
the wide gaps which intersected it, remained firm.
On the left the Royal Canadian Regiment still held
its original position with a resolute calm, though its
right was only supported by Capt. Niven's company,
and they retired at dawn on June 3rd.  Behind
it and in the centre the support line trenches were
intact, and the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light
Infantry and the 42nd still clung to their positions;
just in front of them Lieut. Evans was still holding
the Fortified Post, and no shelling could shift the
Canadian Mounted Rifles from Maple Copse, and
beyond that to the south the 5th Battalion of
the 1st Division were in Square Wood and the
front line leading to Hill 60.  General Macdonell
was up and down his front encouraging his
men by his very presence&mdash;and, indeed, there was
much need of encouragement.  The movements
of the Germans on the overlooking heights were
shrouded in darkness and uncertainty.  They
had been heavily reinforced.[<a id="chap08fn22text"></a><a href="#chap08fn22">22</a>]  There was no
remission of the shell-fire, which alone gave flashes
of light in the darkness except for the white flares
which occasionally illumined the ridges in front,
and might portend the sudden assault of an
overwhelming enemy.
</p>

<p>
Help, however, was at hand.  By the early
afternoon of the 2nd the Higher Command had been
alive to the danger of the attack, and were
informed as to the true position.  The determination
to retake the lost trenches was arrived at, and as
darkness fell the corps began to move in the
direction of the enemy.  Everywhere in the night was
heard the tramp of marching men, and the dim
outlines of endless columns flowing steadily towards
the east were visible on every road.

[<a href="#chap08fn7text">7</a>] The chaplain of the regiment, Capt. A. G. Wilken, was in

[<a href="#chap08fn8text">8</a>] Lieut. Evans was greatly assisted in his defence by Private
Murphy, of the Machine Gun Company of the 8th Brigade, who
beat off every German attack, although his gun was twice buried
by shell-fire.  Lieut. Beatty of the same Company also showed
conspicuous gallantry and ability in organising the machine-gun

used to repel counter-attacks.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The doctrine of the counter-attack is one of the
most simple in theory, and yet it appears to be one
of the most difficult to apply effectively in practice.
The idea is to take advantage of that confusion
which must always beset an enemy in a victorious
advance, and to strike him violently with the impact
of new and well-organised troops from the second
or support line of the defenders.  The French have
reduced this method to a fine art by punishing the
Germans severely in their advance on a lightly held
trench, allowing them to occupy it, and then turning
them out at the point of the bayonet by a strong
counter-attack from troops ready in the support
line trenches just behind.  It may also be used in the
last resort to rally broken troops returning on their
own line and threatening confusion to all concerned,
or to repel an enemy adverse to bayonet fighting,
rather than allow him to get into one's own trench.
</p>

<p>
All these methods of counter-attacking are
largely questions of timing, like the blow delivered
by a skilled boxer.  You cannot hit too soon, but if
you hit too late you fail.  The time limit for the
launching of this assault in the later stages of
modern warfare is practically decided by the
interval which it takes an enemy to get into some kind
of cover and bring up his machine-guns.  After
that the confusion in the ranks of the opponents
has vanished, the machine-guns are waiting, and
artillery preparation is ineffective, as the gunners
have not yet had time to locate and register the
enemy positions with sufficient accuracy to make
sure of putting those machine-guns out of action.
</p>

<p>
This chapter is the record of a counter-attack
which failed, but it is only fair to the brigades
which undertook the assault to point out that it took
place eighteen hours after the Germans had made
their first rush and many hours after they had
fortified their new positions.  During these eighteen
hours it had been impossible to locate with any
exactitude the new lines taken up by the Germans,
so that while our artillery peppered the whole ridge
very effectively, they could not concentrate on and
wipe out trenches of the existence and position of
which they were unaware.
</p>

<p>
It has been pointed out in the last chapter that
the real counter-attack of the afternoon, or evening,
of June 2nd could not be delivered because there
were not at hand troops in sufficient force to attempt
the task.  Gunnery had gone too fast in its
development for infantry tactics.  The rim of the
saucer, which could have been held against all
odds eighteen months before, had been carried
by the new artillery, and yet it was in effect the
last and only defence of the Ypres salient.
It is not possible to-day to defend on a
single line of defence, and yet the Canadian
Corps had been compelled by the logic of
events and the policy of its predecessors to do so.
Indeed, since Lord Ernest Hamilton wrote of the
Mount Sorrel position as "the natural line," the
whole science of defence had undergone a drastic
change owing to the increased sweeping power of
heavy artillery.  A position must have "lungs," as
Verdun proved&mdash;first lines which can be lost without
overwhelming consequences.  In the northern
section of the Ypres salient there were at least three
defensible sets of trenches with good sweeping
ranges of fire, one behind the other, but here in the
south-east the configuration of the ground did not
permit of a dual or triple system.  Lose one
position of defence and you lose all.  This fact no doubt
accounts for the anxiety of the Corps and for the
haste with which the main counter-attack was
launched.
</p>

<p>
The original decision to attack was taken before
4 p.m. on June 2nd, and the Divisional
Commanders of the 1st and 3rd Divisions were aware of it
shortly afterwards, although the actual operation
orders were not issued until 9.45 p.m. that day.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 2nd, 9.45 P.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The real difficulty was to get the troops up in time
for an attack at dawn.  In the ordinary course of
events the natural troops to undertake such a task
are the support and reserve battalions of the
brigades which have lost the position, if a prompt
decision is to be reached before the enemy can build
himself in.  But so serious had been the fighting of
the morning that of these the 49th Battalion
(Edmonton Regiment), Colonel Griesbach, alone had
not yet been drawn into the fighting in the front
line.  The 5th Canadian Mounted Rifles, the 2nd
Canadian Mounted Rifles, and the 42nd Battalion
(Royal Highlanders), under Lieut.-Col. Cantlie,
were already used up.  Furthermore, it was known
that at 9 o'clock on the night of the 2nd the Germans
had been heavily reinforced, and a rough guess
might have put their numbers at anything between
four and five thousand.  A strong assailing force
was therefore necessary.  The 3rd Brigade of the
1st Division, which was in corps reserve, and two
battalions of the 9th Brigade of the 3rd Division,
52nd Battalion, New Ontario Regiment, under
Lieut.-Colonel Hay, and the 60th Battalion
(Victoria Rifles), under Lieut.-Colonel Gascoigne, were
therefore sent up.  Two battalions of the 2nd
Brigade of the 1st Division, 5th Battalion (Western
Cavalry), under Lieut.-Colonel Dyer, and the 8th
Battalion (Winnipeg Rifles), under Major Humble,
were already in the trenches on the right of
the line, and had, with the exception of the 5th
Battalion, been only slightly engaged.  The 7th
(British Columbia) Battalion, under Lieut.-Colonel
Odlum, and the 10th (Western Canada) Battalion,
under Lieut.-Colonel Rattray, were in support and
reserve.
</p>

<p>
The new troops then at the disposal of the General
Officer Commanding in charge of the attack were
the 7th and 10th Battalions (2nd Brigade), General
Lipsett, the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th Battalions
(3rd Brigade), General Tuxford, the 49th of the
7th Brigade, and the 52nd and 60th of the
9th Brigade, making a total of nine battalions.
The 58th and 43rd Battalions of the 9th Brigade
were not made use of in the fighting at the
time.  All these were placed under the command
of General Hoare-Nairne, of the 3rd Division.
That officer, in the conference which preceded the
formation of the plan, had put forward the view
that, rather than make a frontal assault across the
open, it would be better to start from what I have
called the Apex of the defence (the projecting
angle between Zouave Wood and Maple Copse)
and bomb a way up the various communication
trenches towards Hill 62 into the heart of the
enemy's country and then spread right and left
along our own original line.  It was agreed, however,
that such an advance through an intricate tangle of
trenches involved first-hand knowledge of the
ground on the part of the troops engaged;
otherwise the result would be confusion worse
confounded.  None of the fresh troops available
had this knowledge, and it was therefore decided
somewhat reluctantly to risk the frontal assault.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 3rd, 2 A.M.</i>
</span>
The attack was originally to be at dawn and
to be delivered on a wide frontage&mdash;both
precautions to obviate the deadly effect of the
machine-guns.  On the right, Colonel Rattray,
with the 7th in advance and the 10th close
in support, was to carry the south aspect of
Observatory Ridge, and finally Mount Sorrel.
Brigadier-General Lipsett, the Commander of the 2nd
Brigade, was to see that this attack conformed
with the movements of the centre battalions under
General Tuxford of the 3rd Brigade.  These two
were old comrades, and well accustomed to work
together; they decided to set up common Brigade
Headquarters.  The centre was the 3rd Brigade&mdash;the
15th Battalion (48th Highlanders) under Lieut.-Colonel
Bent advancing on the left of the 7th, with
the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish) under
Lieut.-Colonel Leckie in support and the 14th Battalion
(Royal Montreal Regiment), under Major McCombe
to the left again, with the 13th Battalion (Royal
Highlanders) under Lieut.-Colonel Buchanan close
behind it.  The right of the 3rd Brigade was Square
Wood and the left Maple Copse, with Observatory
Ridge Road as the point of junction between its two
battalions.  The objective of the 3rd Brigade
was Hill 62.  Farther north still, and not in
immediate contact, the 49th Battalion of the 7th Brigade
was to attack through the southern section of
Sanctuary Wood and the 52nd Battalion of the 9th
Brigade to the north again, while the 60th Battalion
acted as support.  Their aim was the position
between Hill 62 and the Royal Canadian Regiment,
still in place at Hooge.  Such in brief was the plan.
It was to prove, unfortunately, as fallible in
execution as sweeping measures hurriedly conceived
under the stress of war are apt to be.
</p>

<p>
There were two main difficulties: to get the troops
up in time and to co-ordinate the artillery and the
infantry so as to get the preparation and the assault
to move as if by clockwork.  But time was the great
enemy.  The original attack, as has been stated,
was timed for 2 a.m. on June 3rd.  The 3rd Brigade
was back in Corps Reserve, and found the roads
blocked with ambulances, transport, and ammunition.[<a id="chap09fn1text"></a><a href="#chap09fn1">1</a>]
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 3rd, 4.15 A.M.</i>
</span>
It struggled vigorously, but could not get
into position until 4.15 a.m. on June 3rd, and the
2nd Brigade, which was already on the spot, could
not attack without it.  This upset the whole of the
arrangements with the artillery, and these had to be
rectified under conditions which were far from
satisfactory for accurate Staff work.  The telephone lines
were constantly broken, and the heroic runners were
frequently killed.[<a id="chap09fn2text"></a><a href="#chap09fn2">2</a>]  The armoured cables[<a id="chap09fn3text"></a><a href="#chap09fn3">3</a>] were the
main stand-by.  On the left the 49th were ready at
2.10 a.m., but without their left-hand battalion (the
52nd) or their support (the 60th).  As a result of
these delays, the attack was delivered in broad
daylight, in a succession of waves, against hidden
machine-guns, so that the enemy's fire was
concentrated on each section in turn.  The signal was to
have been six green rockets fired by the 3rd Division
Staff as soon as all the troops were ready.  But this
was, of course, a night and not a day warning, and
by a crowning stroke of misfortune many of the
rockets fired in daylight were faulty, and fourteen
had to be discharged before the requisite number
was reached.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 3rd, dawn.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The day dawned dull and stormy, with dashes of
driving rain which drenched the troops, many of
whom had been marching all night.  And though the
day broke, the signal to attack still tarried hour after
hour.  The 7th and 10th Battalions on the right had
been in position since before 2 a.m., and in waiting
on the others had lost the precious hours of
darkness.  The same fate had befallen the 49th
on the left, which waited interminably for the
battalions of the 9th Brigade which never came.
The 49th Battalion was given permission to charge
at 2 a.m., but their Commander preferred to wait for
the 52nd and 60th rather than risk ruining the whole
affair by an isolated effort.  The 14th and 15th were
ready by 4.15 a.m.  As the chilled soldiers of the
7th, 14th, and 15th peered out in the full grey light
they saw in front of them some hundred yards of
open ground, and behind a tangled, irregular piece
of woodland, sloping up to a low crest.  Somewhere
in this thicket lay the enemy's trenches, but the
precise spot was largely a matter of guesswork, not
of certainty.
</p>

<p>
The time of waiting for the charge is one of tense
anxiety.  As the company commanders consult their
watches and note the passage of the minutes, the
men string themselves up for a final effort.  The
next few seconds will carry them over the parapet
through the shell fire and machine-gun fire into the
enemy trenches if they are fortunate, but in any
case to a fate which no man can predict.  Here the
moments of nervous strain were prolonged hour after
hour until endurance must have become an agony.
But the spirit of the counter-attacking battalions on
the right never faltered, and when the time came at
last they advanced to the assault in the face of a
devastating fire with their customary resolution and
gallantry.
</p>

<p>
The artillery preparation was from the first, in the
opinion of competent witnesses, not adequate for the
task of clearing the way for the infantry.  The
assault, as we know, had been ordered for 2 a.m. on
June 3rd.  The time had to be altered owing to the
delay in the arrival of the infantry in some parts of
the field.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 3rd, 7.00 A.M.</i>
</span>
The new assault was timed for 7 a.m.,
June 3rd, but in one case it was postponed for
another hour owing to the constant breakdown of all
telephone communication between the Higher
Command, the Battalion Commander, and the gunners.
These last had indeed a hard task in any event.
The trenches in front of them had been dug by the
Germans since the assault, and were neither ranged
by observers nor photographed by our aircraft.  The
heavy rain and brooding mists had robbed the guns
of the vision which is essential to accuracy.  They
fired blindly into the positions which the enemy
might be supposed to occupy, and could not give
the infantry the unfailing support which it expects
and almost invariably receives.
</p>

<p>
At last it came!  The green rockets were fired
at 7.10 a.m. of June 3rd, and those battalions which
were ready went over the parapet.  Major Stewart,
an officer of the Canadian Forces, formerly in the
regular U.S.A. Army, was wounded in giving the
7th a lead over the parapet at 7.37 a.m., as they
were clearly puzzled as to whether the signal had
been given or not.  His orderly stopped behind
to bandage his wound, and both were killed in
an instant by a shell.  The 7th Battalion, closely
supported by the 10th, attacked on the extreme
right of the position with the view of clearing
the south edge of Observatory Ridge, and so
getting through to Mount Sorrel.  It was
impossible to go straight for the objective while the
Ridge remained in German hands.  The task was a
very difficult one, and it is not surprising that they
failed.  They were exposed to an enfilade fire from
the position on Hill 60 held by the enemy,[<a id="chap09fn4text"></a><a href="#chap09fn4">4</a>] who as
the 7th Battalion dashed out from the trench,
could see our troops with perfect distinctness.
The enemy were plentifully supplied with
machine-guns, and had even wired their front in
the eighteen hours in which they had enjoyed
undisturbed possession.  They had a particularly new
strong trench just behind Armagh Wood, which held
up the whole centre of the assault, for it had been in
no way impaired by the artillery preparation.
Lieut. Elliott and Lieut. Carstairs, each with a company of
the 7th, attacked on the right, and Captain Holmes
with two companies of the same Battalion and one
of the 10th under Captain Fisher on the left.
Captain Holmes found it impossible to get on, and finally
dug himself in about forty yards in front of the
enemy; Captain Fisher, pressing up to his
assistance, was shot through the head and killed.
Meanwhile a party on the extreme left found a hole in
the enemy's line, and, turning the fatal trench, broke
right through.  But the Germans had reconstructed
the battered Fortified Post, once held by the
C.M.R.'s at this place, and manned it with
machine-guns, which simply swept the bold adventurers out
of existence.  Few returned.  On the right,
Lieut. Elliott fought his way forward and turned the
south end of the German position, reaching the
original trench line just south of Mount Sorrel.
Here, however, he was caught in the right rear
by the German machine-guns on Hill 60.  His
party suffered heavy casualties and he was wounded.
They were not able to hold their ground.
Lieut. Carstairs' company fared no better.  The attack
on the right had broken down, and to press it
was mere suicide on a large scale.  There was no
alternative but for the 2nd Brigade to get back and
turn on the guns.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 3rd, 8.35 A.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Next, to the north, came the 15th Battalion, who
attacked at 8.35 a.m.  They were already astride
the end of the Ridge, but the ground in front of
them had absolutely no cover, and after pushing to
just beyond Rudkin House they were compelled
to stop and dig themselves in under a withering
fire.
</p>

<p>
The 14th Battalion (Royal Montreal Regiment)
was to continue the attack on the north, its right
connecting with the 15th Battalion on Observatory
Ridge.  The connection was duly made earlier in
the night, and the Battalion was in position to attack
at 4.15 a.m. in the morning of June 3rd.  It is of
the essence of an attack made on a broad frontage
that it prevents the concentration of enemy fire at
any one point in the line, and it is therefore essential
that the various assaults should be simultaneous.
This, unfortunately, was not the case with the 14th
Battalion.  Although the regiment had been ready
for some hours and had been notified that the
artillery preparation would begin at 6.15 a.m. and last
till about 7 o'clock, a subsequent message was
received to the effect that the bombardment would not
begin until 7.45 a.m., and therefore terminate at 8.15.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 3rd, 8.17 A.M.</i>
</span>
The battalion in consequence advanced to the attack
at 8.17 in broad daylight against machine-guns, an
hour after the first assault had taken place.  In spite
of these adverse circumstances, the 14th Battalion
went forward without flinching and ultimately linked
itself up with the 15th at Rudkin House on the right
and with Maple Copse on its left.  Here the
regiment dug itself in under the fire of the enemy,
and so with the 15th bridged the fatal gap between
Square Wood and Maple Copse.  The casualties
in the 14th were 387.[<a id="chap09fn5text"></a><a href="#chap09fn5">5</a>]  Two notable feats of arms
were performed on both flanks of the 14th Battalion.
Lieut. Beaton and his platoon pushed right up to
the German lines on the right of the regiment and
maintained himself there until midnight of the
3rd-4th.  On the left Sergeant Topham and fourteen
men broke clean through the enemy and reached a
point not far from our own original front line.  They
were, of course, completely unsupported, and soon
found themselves practically surrounded by the
enemy.  Of Sergeant Topham's party of fifteen, two
succeeded in making a safe return.
</p>

<p>
These stories, however, of isolated bodies getting
through the first German line and penetrating to our
trenches reached the Higher Command and conveyed
to them a totally erroneous view of the actual
situation.  In consequence, although the right and
centre attack had stuck fast after an advance of
200 or 300 yards, the left was urged forward later
in the day under the impression that the whole
enemy position was being carried.[<a id="chap09fn6text"></a><a href="#chap09fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
The position on the extreme left, where the 49th
and 60th[<a id="chap09fn7text"></a><a href="#chap09fn7">7</a>] were to attack through Sanctuary Wood,
was a peculiar one.  The 49th Battalion was in
position by 2.10 a.m., the regiment having moved
steadily to its objective under heavy fire, merely
panting for the fray.  It had not yet been engaged
in any great general action, and was anxious to
give its proofs&mdash;which, indeed, it did most nobly.
Unfortunately, the 52nd and 60th Battalions failed
to arrive in time for the assault, which took place
at 7 a.m. on June 3rd.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 3rd, 7.00 A.M.</i>
</span>
They were caught in
heavy barrages in the only communication trench
which led them to their points of assembly, and
all the senior officers who understood the plan
were either killed or wounded.  The two regiments
became mixed up in the mile-long trench.  The
60th, however, eventually reached the position
originally allotted to them as supporting battalion
in the support trenches, and these lines they
maintained all day of the 3rd under heavy fire, relieving
the P.P.C.L.I. that night.  Colonel Griesbach, who
was in charge of the whole assault, and had
therefore handed over the command of his regiment
to Major Weaver (Major Weaver was hit in the
barrage and handed over his command to Major
Hobbins), twice walked back across the open through
a sleet of steel to consult by telephone with his
Brigadier and to try to find someone in command of
the 52nd or 60th.  In the latter effort he failed, and
these regiments took no part in the assault.  Colonel
Griesbach succeeded, however, in getting on the
telephone with General Macdonell, to whom he
explained the situation.  The General speaks very
highly of the clear grasp of affairs which Colonel
Griesbach displayed.
</p>

<p>
By now, however, the morning had come, and
there were no assembly trenches to shelter large
bodies of men for the assault through Sanctuary
Wood.  The 49th were sheltering in what cover they
could find in the Apex, and the support line in
Sanctuary Wood.  The 52nd and 60th were far
behind, and it became a question whether to assault
with the 49th alone or to abandon the attack
altogether.  Colonel Griesbach decided that it would
be dangerous to let down the battalions on his right,
even though the main plan on the left had gone awry,
and at 7 o'clock the 49th climbed the parapet and
attacked across the open.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 3rd, 7 A.M.</i>
</span>
As they passed through
and to the right of the Princess Patricia's attenuated
companies, these stood up and cheered a new
battalion going out to win its battle honours.  The
Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, in fact,
seem to have contemplated the action which ensued
over ground on which they had just fought in the
spirit of an elder brother watching a younger one
snowing his mettle.
</p>

<p>
The attack of the 49th was well planned and
carried out in a very gallant manner, the officers
leading their men, revolver in hand, to within
point-blank range of the enemy.  In this manner Captain
McNaughton and Lieut. F. W. Scott fell at the high
tide of the assault.  Five officers were killed and
eight wounded.  But the effort was an isolated one,
and was persisted in far too long under the
erroneous impression that the 2nd and 3rd Brigades had
recaptured the old front line and were urgently in
need of support on their left to make the whole
position good.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 3rd, afternoon</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The 49th, at any rate, succeeded in making a
very considerable advance and in establishing
blocks in Sanctuary Wood and in rendering the
apex of the new front line comparatively safe from
assault.  Finally, on advice from the officers of the
Princess Patricia's they desisted from any further
attempt to advance to the old front line, and rested
content with the security of the new line which their
own gallantry and persistence had achieved.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 3rd, 6 P.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
By 6 p.m. of the evening of June 3rd it was known
that the counter-attack had failed in its main object.
The strange stories about capturing the original
trenches had withered away, by their lack of proof
and by their intrinsic absurdity.  The enemy neither
fainted nor failed, but remained roughly where he
stood at the beginning of the day, though he had
been thrust back here and there.  None the less, the
failure had achieved certain important objects.  It
had made good the line which now ran continuously
from the Menin Road to Hill 60 in a shape which,
though irregular, was firm.  The deadly danger of
the afternoon of June 2nd no longer existed.  The
fatal gap had been closed.  The spirit of the
Canadians had risen in the face of adversity and proved
to the Württembergers that as long as the Corps
stood in the entrance there was no easy road to what
remained of the famous city of Ypres.  The 1st
Division had saved the town from entrance by the
north a year before; the Corps had protected it from
the tramp of German infantry advancing from the
south.  That heap of stone and rubble, with its one
projecting pinnacle, still remained inviolate and
inviolable.  The line was not a good one, but it was
a line still.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the regiments of the 3rd Division had
proved themselves in action on the big scale, and
so had entered into the fellowship of arms of the
Canadian Corps.  It has not been necessary to
dwell at any length on the 1st Division, which, from
brigadiers down to privates, behaved with the skill
and courage of experienced veterans.
</p>

<p>
But if this chapter is one of failure it is not devoid
of consolation.  The 3rd Division in its first great
fight had won its battle honours.  Deprived at the
very outset of the encounter of the services of its
General and one of his brigadiers, assailed by the
fiercest bombardment British troops had yet encountered,
with a first line swept out of existence and a
second line full of rending gaps, it yet held on and
changed the fortunes of the third battle of Ypres
until the prospect of an overwhelming defeat was
turned into the achievement of a final victory.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap09fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap09fn1text">1</a>] It is impossible to pass over the check thus experienced by
the 3rd Brigade without commenting on the reason for much
misfortune to the British Armies during the two years of war on
the Western front&mdash;the inadequate system of light railways.  I
have witnessed on many occasions blocks on the roads in Flanders
caused by ambulance and transport wagons going down and
infantry and ammunition wagons coming up, whereby hours were
lost, very often at critical moments.  Many of these checks might
have been avoided altogether if a system of light railways had
been constructed behind the trenches as soon as it became apparent
that trench warfare had rendered the contending armies immobile
for a long period of time.  Since Sir Douglas Haig took
command there has been a great improvement in this direction, but
it is difficult to make up for lost time.  I could not help thinking
of the contrast between this delay and the rapidity and skill with
which Sir William Mackenzie drove his railway across the
Canadian prairies, not unlike the plains and plateaus of Flanders.
The military leaders, indeed, with their technical staff training,
lagged far behind in a task which would have been accomplished
rapidly by experts like Sir Herbert Holt.  Possibly, however, they
had not the requisite authority from the Government to employ
civilians in engineering tasks and in transportation problems.  It
must be added, however, that there were two principal difficulties
which it took time to overcome: the shortage of shipping to
carry over the material, and the dual, and sometimes triple, control
of the railways by the British, French, and Belgian authorities.

A LULL IN THE STORM.  THE FIGHT FOR HOOGE
</h4>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
After the storm which had blown for thirty hours
since the morning of June 2nd, a kind of lull settled
down on the field.  The artillery bombardments on
both sides showed that the fighting was by no means
finished, but the infantry remained on the ground
where the assault of June 3rd had left them.  It
was now necessary to relieve the decimated
front-line battalions.
</p>

<p>
The 6th Brigade was in reserve of the 2nd
Division, and it was decided to bring it up to the
Hooge section on the left, but this move was not
finally completed until the night of the 5th-6th, when
the Royal Canadian Regiment was relieved by the
28th (North-West) Battalion.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 4th, 8.30 A.M.</i>
</span>
At 8.30 a.m. on the
4th the battalions of the 2nd and 3rd Brigades in the
firing line were relieved by the 1st Brigade; the 1st
Battalion (Ontario Regiment) under Lieut.-Colonel
Hodson took the place of the 7th and 10th from
the old line to Square Wood; and the 2nd
Battalion (Eastern Ontario) was substituted for the
15th and 14th in the new trench from Square Wood
to Maple Copse.  On the following day the 43rd,
52nd, 58th, and 60th Battalions, 9th Brigade,
relieved the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light
Infantry and the 49th Battalion in the centre of the
position at 12.45 p.m., and these regiments were
able to go back for a well-deserved rest.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 5th</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The casualties of the 7th Brigade had indeed been
severe, totalling in all 45 officers and 1,051 men,
and making up with those sustained by the 8th
Brigade considerably more than 3,000, apart from
the losses incurred by the 60th and 52nd Battalions
of the 9th Brigade.  The effect of the action can
be seen by giving the rifle strength of the Brigade
as it came out of the fighting.  This was as
follows:&mdash;Royal Canadian Regiment, 500; the Princess
Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, 210; 42nd
Battalion, 460; 49th Battalion, 450; or 1,620 to a
Brigade, which, if it had been at the full strength of
900 rifles to a battalion, would have numbered 3,600,
or nearly three to one of the actual survivors.  They
had left their trenches, however, sensibly improved,
chiefly owing to the efforts of the 3rd Pioneer
Battalion, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Holmes, which
all through the action continued to make good the
new front line and to dig trenches in support of it.
This work was indeed essential, as it must be
remembered that the larger part of the new position had
never been intended for defence at all.
</p>

<br />
Map&mdash;BATTLE OF HOOGE 5th TO 6th JUNE 1916
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, it became clear that the situation
could not be left as it was.  Officers' patrols had
been out on the night of the 4th-5th and had located
the enemy's position fairly accurately.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night, 4th-5th.</i>
</span>
But while
the Higher Command was planning the counterstroke,
the enemy moved suddenly against the only
part of the front line which remained in our possession.
</p>

<p>
The knoll of Hooge, if it hardly formed part of
Mount Sorrel Ridge system, was yet an eminence of
great importance, for from it one could look straight
down to the walls of Ypres.  It had in consequence
changed hands over and over again, until the
chateau, stables, and tiny village were nothing but a
rubble heap of bricks stained with the best blood of
Great Britain and Canada.  Its last adventure had
been in the summer of 1915, when it was lost on
July 31st and retaken by the 6th Division on August
8th.  Since then, however, the advance trenches had
been pushed forward until they were right at the
east end of the village and looked down on Lake
Bellewaarde.  On the left the ground falls swiftly,
too, to Bellewaarde Beek, on the other side of which
was the 60th British Brigade.  The line here was
exposed and open to the Germans on the higher
ground, and was only held by a series of bombing
posts.
</p>

<p>
On the night of the 5th-6th the 28th Battalion
came up to relieve the Royal Canadian Regiment.
The direct way up to Hooge is the Menin Road,
straight from the historic gate.  But you will not take
that way unless you are anxious for death, for it is
ranged to the last millimetre.  The battalion will
turn outside the gate, which has seen so many armies
and generations pass, and skirt the edge of the calm
and stagnant moat.  Then it will turn through
the long grass and water meadows such as fringe
the Thames, and finally into the communication
trenches.  After this descent it is a question of a
long struggle up the communication trenches, of
clawing one's way through abandoned telephone
wires which conspire in the effort to strangle, and of
climbing and leaping shell-holes where the German
guns have struck the trench with accuracy.  Finally
comes the Menin Road again.  The great causeway
runs straight with the rectitude of a Roman road.
But there is added to it modern engineering,
which has raised it twenty feet above the ground on
each side.  The road is lined with poplars, now
mostly decapitated and scarred.  Now and again,
as the relieving battalion advances, a high, shrill
noise will be heard overhead, followed by the
flash and detonation of shells among the shattered
trees.  The 28th Battalion, used to these manifestations,
plodded steadily up to the relief of the Royal
Canadian Regiment on the night of June 5th.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>Night of June 5th.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
There are three lines of trenches of great
importance in the Hooge position.  The
front-line trenches are now pushed forward to the
extreme limit of the village beyond the crater
the British blew up in August, 1915&mdash;for these
look down into the valley of the Germans,
though they are, in their turn, somewhat
commanded by the enemy's heights at Bellewaarde
Farm.  These trenches connect with the British on
the left of this rise beyond Bellewaarde Beek, and
on the right stretch as far as the gap which leads
down to Zouave Wood.
</p>

<p>
Some two hundred yards behind lies a support
line, a good trench leading down to the Beek.  Its
field of fire is limited by the slope of the ground
upwards towards the front-line trenches.  North-east
it commands a good field of fire, and proved, in
consequence, useful to the 28th Battalion when the front
line had been abandoned.  Behind the support line
the machine-guns were concentrated for the defence,
and behind that again was another set of trenches.
</p>

<p>
The disposition of the 6th Brigade was as
follows:&mdash;One and a half companies of the 28th in
the front line and in bombing posts.  The remaining
two platoons and the machine-gun sections were in
the support line.  The machine-gun sections
consisted of three Colt guns left by the 7th Brigade,[<a id="chap10fn1text"></a><a href="#chap10fn1">1</a>]
two Lewis guns of the Royal Canadian Regiment,
one Colt gun of the 6th Brigade Machine-Gun
Company, and in addition a Stokes gun.  The other two
companies of the 28th were in support trenches by
the Menin Road.  The 31st Battalion was in
reserve along with a company of the 60th Battalion
of the 9th Brigade, which it was found impossible
to relieve at the last moment on the night of the
5th-6th.  The 29th and 27th were in Brigade reserve.
Shortly after midnight the 6th Brigade was in
position.  The shelling during the night was very
heavy, and the relief was, in consequence,
accomplished under some difficulties, but as these bursts
of fury died away time after time there was no
particular reason to suspect an attack of the German
infantry.  At 7 a.m. on the 6th an unprecedented
bombardment began once more, and lasted until the
very moment of the assault at Hooge seven hours
later.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 6th, 7 A.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
One vital fact was entirely unknown to the Royal
Canadian Regiment and the 7th Brigade.  The
Germans in planning their attack on Mount Sorrel
and Hill 62 had not in the least forgotten the
importance of the knoll at Hooge.  It was necessary to
capture it if the new line was to be made complete
and the Ypres salient finally broken.  Their right
wing had, as has been recorded, lapped round in
the direction of the village and had been driven back
by the sturdy fire of its defenders.  But long before
this they had made their plans and had driven four
mines right under the front-line trenches.  When
the hour of attack at 2 p.m. came the mines were
sprung simultaneously.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 6th, 2 P.M.</i>
</span>
The aeroplane photographs
after the event show them actually overlapping in
the craters they threw up.  The explosion was
horrible, and one entire company of the 28th perished
in it almost to the last man.  Many of the remaining
company of the 28th were involved in the
catastrophe; the bombing posts were abandoned and the
survivors concentrated in the support trenches.  Yet
so tremendous was the noise of the artillery
preparation that the garrisons in the Fortified Posts behind
were quite unaware that any mines had been
exploded until the survivors began to arrive, although
they were but a little distance from the scene of this
tremendous detonation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 6th, afternoon.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
After this the day of the 6th witnessed some very
fierce fighting.  The Germans had already taken the
whole Canadian front line from the gap to Mount
Sorrel on the morning of June 2nd, and were
determined to carry the remainder at Hooge on the
6th.  Soon after the mines had exploded they
came forward in the usual formation with packs
on their shoulders like men expecting no
resistance.  So far as the front line was concerned
they were right; otherwise they made an error.
They occupied the remains of the trenches in
Hooge and assaulted the 60th British Brigade
opposite Bellewaarde Farm, but were repulsed
with considerable loss by the resolute infantry
of the British Brigade which had neither been
mined at all nor bombarded to any considerable
extent.  The enemy then came straight down
the line of the Menin Road both on the right- and
the left-hand sides.  By this time, however, the
resistance, in spite of the continuous bombardment.
had been organised by Captain Styles, of the 28th,
who was fortunate in having at his disposal in the
support line such an exceptionally strong force of
machine-guns.
</p>

<p>
The battle was back on the old line always
occupied when Hooge is lost, and was defended with
the greatest obstinacy by the Canadian infantry and
gunners.  On the left-hand side of the causeway
the enemy got as far down the hill as Bellewaarde
Beek, but any further advance was swept out of
existence by the machine-guns in the support line.  On
our right side of the Menin Road the attack
appeared more dangerous.  The enemy succeeded
in jumping from shell hole to shell hole, and
attained dangerous proximity to our support line.
But here again the 28th drove them back by rifle
and machine-gun fire.[<a id="chap10fn2text"></a><a href="#chap10fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 6th, 3.30 P.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
By 3.30 p.m. on June 6th the attack on the
support line had been repulsed for the moment by
Captain Styles and the machine-guns, but it persisted
on the right-hand side of the road all the afternoon.
At about 4 o'clock the enemy determined to attack
the support trenches now held by the 31st.  Their
avenue of approach was obvious.  It was through
the gap and down by the Zouave Wood.  This is an
old field of battle, fought over until every yard
of earth is covered with the relics of the slain.  Here
in October of 1914 seven hundred of the Prussian
Guard broke clean through the British front line,
and paused as though bewildered when they found
they had attained their object.  They were
immediately caught in reverse by the fire of the 7th
Division, still holding the slope of the ridge to the right
and left, and charged from the support trenches by
the 52nd (Oxfordshire Light Infantry), who killed
them to a man.  For many months afterwards their
piled bodies still cumbered the ground.  The
Germans, undismayed by this precedent, attacked down
Zouave Wood at 4 o'clock and renewed their
attempts during the course of the evening.  The
support trenches are good ones, the field of fire
excellent, the wood itself devoid of all substantial
cover, and the enemy gained nothing by the attempt
except a heavy list of casualties.  Hooge had gone,
but the support line still remained.[<a id="chap10fn3text"></a><a href="#chap10fn3">3</a>]  The main
attacks were delivered in two waves at five yards'
interval and fifty yards' distance.  But although all
the main attacks were repelled, the Germans
succeeded in establishing small posts down our old
communication trenches in the Zouave Wood area.
</p>

<p>
Early on the night of the 6th-7th the bombardment,
which had been applied to the whole area for
nearly seventeen hours, died away.  None the less,
the casualties of the 6th Brigade were serious&mdash;20
officers and 580 men.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 6-7th, night.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The whole line, then, had gone, and Ypres
remained open to its assailants.  This is the first
reflection on the loss of the village of Hooge.  But
all the time that attack was going on, and some time
before it, the powers that be had been brooding
darkly over methods of retaliation and reconquest.
It was time to teach the enemy that two could play
at the game of the new artillery preparation, and
ground lost by that method could as speedily be
regained.  In the next chapter we shall see how
these plans evolved themselves and what the result
of the trial was.  As it is, on the night of the 6th, the
Germans were sitting on the rim of the saucer
imagining that in the third battle of Ypres they had
at last conquered the salient.

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap10fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap10fn2text">2</a>] The advance of the enemy down the communication trench

nearest to the front and drove them back with bombs.

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is difficult to penetrate the mind of the German
Headquarters Staff.  The enemy had, by a profuse
expenditure of ammunition and a great
concentration of heavy guns, conquered the last defensive
position which guarded Ypres on the south-east.
The Canadians lay below them in hastily
constructed trenches on the flat, where every move was
visible to the keen observers on the heights above.
One would imagine that the next step would
be to turn the guns on again to destroy far weaker
positions, to break the salient finally, and to compel
the retirement of two army corps to posts far
back in the rear.  Yet after June 6th the
Germans made no move and allowed the initiative to
pass into Canadian hands.  The best explanation
of this singular line of conduct has been suggested
by the Army Commander, who held that the sole
object of the attack was to compel the British to
move troops from other parts of the line.
</p>

<p>
The idea of the Anglo-French offensive in the
summer of 1916 had long been a nightmare to the
great Headquarters Staff.  They dreamt of the
continual piling up of men and munitions from beyond
the narrow seas at some pre-arranged point; they
believed that a vigorous offensive at one or two
places would disturb their opponents and confuse
the threatened move.  According to this theory,
Verdun and the third battle of Ypres were
defensive-offensive operations.  Neither action prevented the
offensive at the Somme.  However that may be, the
Germans remained impassive after their first two
strokes, while the Canadian Corps devoted itself in
quietness and confidence to the preparation of the
real attack.  They borrowed liberally both in men
and guns from the army corps on their right and left,
but no general reserve of the British Army was
shifted to imperil the great offensive on the Somme.
There has been nothing pleasanter in the course of
the campaign than the feeling of good comradeship,
common among soldiers, which subsisted between
the Imperial Service and the Canadian Corps.  The
Canadian Corps had borne the brunt of the fighting
on the Ypres salient, and, as far as they were
concerned, to ask was to have.  A British brigade was
moved into the St. Eloi district, so as to set the
2nd Division free for retaliation.  A reserve cavalry
division of the British Army was moved up at once
to occupy the third line in order that the Canadian
generals might have no doubt as to their freedom of
action in moving to the final assault against the
captured positions.  The Higher Command now had
the reserves necessary to make them secure in an
advance, and they certainly needed such security.
In the fighting which ensued between June 2nd and
14th every Brigade of the Canadian Corps was fully
engaged, and many of them suffered severe casualties.
None the less, they endured until the end and
the Canadians regained the lost ground.  Their
attitude is best summed up by the remark of a
senior Staff Officer, who, basing prejudice on
military knowledge, declared "that this was a
personal matter between the Württembergers and the
Canadians and that the Canadians were going to
win."  Troops animated by this spirit are not likely
to fail.
</p>

<p>
But the work of the real counter-attack had to be
done behind the lines.  The failure of the first
effort had been due to lack of artillery preparation
on unknown trenches.  None the less, the heavy
guns were on the march.  Some were asked
for from neighbouring Army Corps, others were
freely offered as a voluntary contribution to the
gallantry of the Canadian infantry.  The new
reinforcements were stupendous.
</p>

<p>
General Burstall, of the Canadian Corps, thus
commanded one of the greatest assemblages of
guns ever concentrated on the British front.  I have
described already the effect of the enemy's
bombardment on the Canadian front.  The Germans
were now about to get a little of their own medicine
back.  The guns were divided into groups, the
trenches accurately ranged, and each battery was
given its definite and proper objective.
</p>

<p>
On the other side of the line, one must conceive
the Germans toiling mightily, with the assiduity of
coral insects, to make good what they seem to have
imagined was to be their permanent home.  Their
industry was certainly marvellous.  When the
weather grew clear again and the aeroplane
photographs could be taken, they showed no fewer than
eight communication trenches driven up from the
old German line to the new one, and an entire and
excellent support line, dug just west of our own
original front trench, now battered almost out of
recognition, while the assault revealed deep
dug-outs innumerable.  So, from June 4th to June 12th
the powers of offence and defence got ready, one for
the other.
</p>

<br />
Map&mdash;POSITION 9th-l2th JUNE BEFORE SUCCESSFUL ATTACK
</p>

<p>
But while the heavy guns were being brought into
position, it was necessary to reorganise the infantry
and to mass the Corps for a strong and concerted
attack.  An immediate assault had been put out of
the question by the failure of June 3rd.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 4th-12th.</i>
</span>
The enemy's trenches had to be located accurately before
the fire of the guns could be directed upon them.
For some days after the 3rd the weather remained
unfavourable, and in the heavy rains and mists it
was impossible for our aircraft to obtain good
photographs, or for the ranging shots of our guns to be
observed adequately.  This delay gave us an
opportunity for the reorganisation of the infantry,
preparatory to a general assault, and it is, after all, by
the infantry that the final issue will be decided.
The Canadian battalions were therefore massed in
great strength for the night of the 12th-13th.
</p>

<p>
The 9th British Brigade took over the St. Eloi
sector, and thus released the 2nd Division, which
was enabled to take over the ground on the northern
sector, while the 1st Division prepared for the
attack, and recuperated its forces in rest billets.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 8-9th.</i>
</span>
When the reliefs had been accomplished the
position on June 8th was as follows: 6th Brigade of
the 2nd Division at Hooge, and 9th Brigade of
the 3rd Division from Zouave Wood to Maple
Copse; 5th Brigade of the 2nd Division in line
of Maple Copse to Hill 60; 4th Brigade of 2nd
Division from Hill 60 to Ypres-Commes Canal;
9th British Brigade in the St. Eloi sector.

Map&mdash;POSITION BEFORE &amp; AFTER ATTACK ON NIGHT 12th-13th JUNE 1916
</p>

<p>
The accompanying sketch will make the position
of June 9th quite clear.  The 2nd Division were to
hold the line while the attacking brigades were
reorganised.  The 1st Division was given the post
of honour; but its formation was entirely altered for
the purpose of the battle.  It was necessary to
secure two elements: knowledge of the ground
and a sufficient number of battalions which had not
been too severely punished in the action of June 3rd.
Further, it was essential to secure the conjoint
services of the two Brigadiers, General Tuxford and
General Lipsett, who were familiar with the locality
and accustomed to work together.  With these
objects in view the 1st Division was redistributed
in the following manner:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
General Lipsett took command of the 1st, 3rd,
7th and 8th Battalions for the right attack.  General
Tuxford took command of the 2nd, 4th, 13th and
16th Battalions for the left attack, while General
Hughes remained as Divisional Reserve with the
5th, 10th, 14th and 15th Battalions to push the matter
through should any disaster overtake the leading
regiments.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 12th.</i>
</span>
The map will show the disposition of
our forces and the great mass of infantry assembled
for the purpose of retaking the lost position.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 11-12th, night.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The 2nd Division was relieved by the 1st
Division on the night of the 11th-12th preceding
the attack at dawn of the 12th-13th.  The artillery
in the meantime had not been idle.  Apart from
pounding the German position in a regular and
methodical spirit, it had indulged in the last few
days in bursts of intensive fire, which seemed to
herald an infantry assault which did not take place.
By this time the Germans were first of all demoralised
by being kept on perpetual tenterhooks, and
finally lulled into a false security.  So much was
this the case that our final attack, though preceded
by three-quarters of an hour's intense preparation,
caught them in the middle of a relief.[<a id="chap11fn1text"></a><a href="#chap11fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
The frontage of the attack was one of three
battalions, the 3rd, 16th and 13th, from right to left.
Strong reserves were behind, and on both flanks
demonstrations would be made, the 7th loosing
smoke bombs from Hill 60 and confusing the enemy
with a bombing attack, while the 58th made a severe
bombing attack up the well-fought-over communication
trenches by the Apex on the left of the 1st
Division, and were to link up finally with the
captured position.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 12th, 8.30 P.M.</i>
</span>
In the evening of June 12th, at
8.30, a tremendous bombardment was directed on
the German trenches before the last light failed;
at 12.45 a.m. of June 13th the tempest of the
guns would be let loose once more, and at 1.30
the guns would lift and the battalions advance
to the assault in successive lines, each supporting
regiment occupying trenches in front of them as
soon as they were vacated by their predecessors.
The Staff preparations had been complete and were
crowned with success.  In this, as in previous
operations of the 1st Division told in this volume,
Major-General Currie exhibited the skill and resolution
which he had shown in so marked a degree at the
second battle of Ypres.  He achieved, however, so
great a reputation at that action that it would seem
almost superfluous to mention that the conduct of
affairs in his hands was efficient and successful.  He
was greatly assisted in his operations by
Lieut.-Colonel Kearsley, the Chief Staff Officer of the
Division.  Brigadier-General Harington, of the
Corps Staff, did much to perfect the plan of
operations.  He left the Canadians, much to their regret,
shortly after the action to take up a superior
command.  He stayed long enough, however, to see an
action which had begun as a reverse turned into a
striking triumph.  But the main credit must be given
to General Byng, who well sustained his previous
military reputation in laying down the outline of
the plan which brought success, and in supervising
its preparation.
</p>

<p>
It had been agreed that, in the event of a check
taking place anywhere, flares should be sent up to
indicate the position stormed by the assailants, and
for this purpose the objectives were divided into
four successive lines.  It would, perhaps, be unwise
to give further details of these arrangements, and
one may be content to remark that they worked
admirably.  Finally, when the 3rd Battalion arrived
at Mount Sorrel on the right, the 16th at Hill 62 in
the centre, and the 13th to the old lines to the north
of this, a red flare from each section would be the
signal that the whole position was taken.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 12-13th, night.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
The weather throughout the attack was of the
vilest description, the rain coming down in torrents;
but it was not, as subsequent events will show,
altogether unfavourable to the successful prosecution
of the adventure.  The new wire which had been
placed along the front by the 2nd Division was
removed early in the night of the 12th, for to do so
before would have been to evoke suspicion; and
planks were placed across the trenches to allow the
supports to cross them quickly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 13th, 12.45 A.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Then at 12.45 the guns began.  For three-quarters
of an hour the air was full of the preparation.
An enormous force of heavy artillery
had been assembled, against which no ordinary
parapet or traverse would stand for an instant.  The
18-pounders reached an astonishing total, with
several Belgian field guns in addition.  It is true
that the whole of this artillery would not be turned
on the actual field of battle.  Some of it was to
be employed for purposes subsidiary to the action.
None the less, a great battery of guns of
all calibres pointed their muzzles towards the
Germans on Hill 62 and Mount Sorrel.  The
enemy's positions on Mount Sorrel and Hill 62
were to be shelled upon a frontage of 1,500
and to a depth of 1,000 yards, while it was
the ambition of the artillery to break to pieces, day
in and day out, some 10,000 yards of German
trenches, so that when the moment for the assault
arrived the infantry could go forward, in General
Burstall's words, with slung rifles.  This ambition
they very nearly fulfilled, as the light casualty lists
of the 1st Division show.  The infantry would be
the first to acknowledge the immense debt they owed
to the artillery behind them.
</p>

<p>
War, while it is in one sense a contest between
two opponents, is also a struggle between the
weapons of offence and the methods of defence.  A
strange kind of attack suddenly grows formidable,
and after winning one or two resounding victories
is countered by the cunning brains which organise
an appropriate form of resistance.  On the other
hand, man raises what appears to be an impregnable
bar to the forward progress of armies; instantly, far
away, perhaps in laboratories beyond the seas,
human intelligence is contriving to break the bar
and to prove that it is impossible for any one force
to say to another, "So far shalt thou go and no
farther."  In this interplay of forces the functions
of the infantry, cavalry and artillery are constantly
changing.  Now one has, for a short period, a
greater superiority and importance, and then the
circle swings round and
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The spoke which is to-day on top<br />
  To-morrow's on the ground."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
In all these calculations, each side is fallible until it
has gained by experience.
</p>

<p>
It is a general and very fallacious view that the
Germans foresaw all these developments of war and
prepared for them, while the Allies were caught
napping.  Nothing could be more untrue.  The
Germans were better prepared for all possible
eventualities than anyone else, but no soldier in any army
foresaw the actual course which modern warfare
would take.  As a matter of fact, the development
of trench warfare and the reign of the machine-gun
was so fatal a blow to German prospects that it is
improbable that they would have declared war at all
if they had thought it anything more than a bare
possibility.  To them it was a matter of life and
death to keep the armies on the move&mdash;life if they
could crush the French and British armies in the
field and then turn back on Russia; death if they
were condemned to a static defence while the
invincible resources of the Allies in men and money
accumulated slowly on either front.  History decided at
the Marne in favour of the latter alternative.
</p>

<p>
From the date of the Aisne the infantry in
defence gained a decided superiority over the
artillery in attack and kept it for many months after the
race to Calais had locked the lines in Western
Europe.  The enemy possessed indeed a great
superiority in heavy guns, but it was not sufficient to
blow out of its position a resolute corps or army.
The deadlock was complete.  The gunners could
not destroy the trenches and the machine-gun
emplacements sufficiently to allow the infantry to
advance, and time was on our side.  It was in the
attempt to break through this impasse that gas was
first used at Ypres; but after that terrible experience
the defence produced the gas helmet, and the new
weapon broke in the German's hands.
</p>

<p>
Then began the race between the contending
armies to produce guns and shells of such size and
in such quantities as would blast a whole area with
death, bury the machine-guns and the garrisons,
destroy the superiority of the infantry in defence, and
give the game once more into the hands of the offensive.
In this race we were slow starters.  The generals
took time to realise the necessities of the new
situation, and it was not until the cyclonic energy of
Mr. Lloyd George was harnessed to the work of the
Munitions Department that the vast industrial
resources of Great Britain were really brought into
play.  It was a work which required not only the
energy of genius, but the tact of a consummate man
of affairs conversant with all the details of civilian
life.  But presently the machine began to work and
to gather momentum in its course.  Every private
concern adapted to the task was taken over and
pressed into the work.  The factories smoked on
every hillside and the furnaces flared in every city.
The vast metal tubes of the guns took shape, and a
tremendous volume of shells began to flow in
ever-increasing numbers across the Channel.  By the
summer the work was well in hand and the guns
were ready to overpower the defence of the German
defenders and clear the way for the 1st Division.
On that June night Mr. Lloyd George was fighting
on Canada's side.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 13th, 1.30 A.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
Then, as the guns lifted, the infantry charged.
On the right Lieut.-Col. Allan led the 3rd Toronto
Battalion forward, with the 1st Battalion close in
support.  So dense was the brushwood in Armagh Wood
that in the first stages they went forward in the curious
formation of sections in file.  Advancing with great
dash, they got in advance of the enemy's barrage
before the latter could be turned on to our trenches,
and took the Germans' front line.  One of our
Fortified Posts, then in the enemy's hands, turned a
machine-gun and rifle fire on them, but the fort was
taken by assault and the garrison bayoneted in the
fighting.  This Fortified Post represented the left
of the 3rd Battalion, and thenceforward they met
with little opposition here and in the centre, except
attacks from isolated bombing posts, and their
casualties were almost entirely due to enemy shell
fire.  They rushed a position somewhere in the
region of their old line on Mount Sorrel, as soon as
our guns lifted to the old German line, and were the
first of the attackers to signal that the final objective
had been reached at ten minutes past two in the
morning of June 13th, forty minutes from the
commencement of the action.
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 13th, 2.10 A.M.</i>
</span>
The right-hand company,
however, working up the old front line British
trenches, was somewhat delayed by an obstinate
resistance, but with the assistance of a company of
the 1st Battalion it also pushed through.
</p>

<p>
The night of the attack was, as has been stated,
dark and squally.  The rain blew in great gusts,
drenching the waiting battalions to the skin and
filling the assembly trenches knee-deep in water.
But these conditions suggested to the mind of
Colonel J. E. Leckie, of the 16th Battalion, or centre
attack, a particularly daring scheme.  Two of his
subalterns, Lieuts. Adams[<a id="chap11fn2text"></a><a href="#chap11fn2">2</a>] and Scroggie, had been
for some days reconnoitring and crawling about the
ground in front, with the view of guiding the
Battalion during the actual assault.[<a id="chap11fn3text"></a><a href="#chap11fn3">3</a>]  In the course of
these investigations they had come across an old
trench marked on no map and about 100 yards in
front of the Canadian first line.  Such a trench is
a common feature on ground which has been much
fought over.  It was suggested that if the leading
lines of the Battalion crept up during the night to
this new position they would be 100 yards nearer
their objective and would probably escape the
German artillery fire, which would break out on our
front line the instant our guns lifted and the attack
was seen to be imminent.  Such a course had great
advantages.  On the other hand, Colonel Leckie
had to consider the fact that an encounter with a
patrol or a listening post of the enemy would give
away the secret of an attack the prospect of which
had, so far, been sedulously guarded from reaching
the ears of the enemy.  A premature brush on the
part of a company with even a small section of the
enemy would have meant flares and infantry firing
along the whole line and the plan would have
stood disclosed.  Colonel Leckie decided to take
the risk and the responsibility.  His regiment
was drawn up for the assault on a frontage
of two half-companies in four successive lines.
The first two lines were passed successfully up
to the unmarked trench without any suspicion of
their intention reaching the enemy.  The margin
between success and failure was, however, narrow
to the last inch.  The Germans had actually put out
a listening post well in front of their line, but the
advance guards of the 16th (Canadian Scottish)
passed by it in the dark.  By the time the Germans
discovered the presence of the Canadians they were
hemmed in in front and rear, and remained quiescent
until dawn led to their discovery and surrender.  Of
course, they ought to have fired their rifles and given
the alarm at any cost to themselves.
</p>

<p>
But the manoeuvre succeeded, like many risky
chances taken in war.  The enemy's shells missed
the two front lines completely as the 16th Battalion
charged straight into the German positions.  The
two supporting lines, on the other hand, suffered
somewhat severely from ranged shell-fire as they
climbed the parapet.  The first two waves of the
assault met, indeed, with little resistance owing to
the unexpected rapidity of their advance&mdash;a plan
since extensively adopted in the fighting on the
Somme.
</p>

<p>
Isolated German parties of bombers or machine-gunners
still put up a fleeting resistance.  In
the face of these assaults the Canadian infantry
moved steadily on with the quietude of fate.  The
second two waves of the 16th, on approaching the
German front line, were met in places by machine-gun
fire and by a bombing resistance, in which Captain
Wood, an American Army officer whose
services were very valuable to the Canadians, was
killed.  The trench was soon taken and the enemy
who resisted were bayoneted.  The survivors, who
were taken prisoners, appeared to be dazed and
to possess neither rifles nor equipment.  About
thirty yards behind this line, however, a machine-gun
was still in action and was causing many casualties
in our ranks.  Captain Bell-Irving dashed out
from the line, got behind the gun, shot three of the
team with his revolver, and, picking up a rifle,
charged in from the rear and killed the remaining
gunners with the bayonet.  Line after line was
carried in this fashion until the 16th were able to put
up the red flares, which signalled to the division
that they had recaptured the heights and stood once
more on their old ground or in its immediate vicinity.
Although not so quick to arrive as the 3rd Battalion,
they were soon in touch with it, and the new
line was linked up.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, on the left the 13th Battalion (Royal
Highlanders of Canada), under Lieut.-Colonel
Buchanan, had advanced at a given signal.  The
German artillery had ranged their assembly trenches
during our own bombardment and inflicted
somewhat severe losses on them before they climbed the
parapet at the correct moment.  They set out in
the usual formation of four waves on a frontage of
two half companies, the first two waves under Major
Perry and the last two under Major McCuaig, and,
advancing across broken ground under heavy shell
fire, reached their first objective.  Here they were
held up for a time by a machine-gun on their left
front; a bombing party had to be sent round its rear
to destroy it before the regiment could proceed.
Finally, after some isolated bombing encounters in
the communication trenches, the 13th broke through
to the north of Hill 62 and linked up with the 16th
on their right.[<a id="chap11fn4text"></a><a href="#chap11fn4">4</a>]  The circle from left to right was
now complete, for the 58th (Colonel Genet), fighting
their way slowly up the communication trenches on
the left of the 13th, finally established touch with
them.  The main action was over shortly after 2.30
on the morning of June 13th.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
<i>June 13th, 2.30 A.M.</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the right the 1st Division had not, as they
thought, retaken the precise position held by the
3rd Division on June 1st, although in the heat of
the assault they were fully convinced that they had
done so, and, in fact, succeeded in doing so on the
following day.  The Germans had built a new
support trench somewhat to the west of the
original British line, and this was in very good
condition.  In the meantime, a fortnight of
rain and heavy bombardments, both from British
and German guns, had practically obliterated the
old first line.  In the confusion of the final onrush
in a half-light the company commanders of the various
battalions occupied at once the first sound trench
which obviously held a dominating position looking
towards the east, and, in doing this, they no doubt
stopped on the right 50 yards short of their
objective.  Such an error must be regarded as trivial by
those who understand the conditions of modern
warfare; it is a mistake which is bound to be made over
and over again, even by the best infantry in the
world, and is a far less dangerous offence than the
opposing one of overcharging the position.  Bombing
posts were at once established down the German
communication trenches and all measures taken
against threatened counter-attacks.  Immediately
behind the assaulting waves came the Pioneers
carrying on them the materials for consolidating and
making good the captured trench the very instant it
was clear of the enemy.  In this work, Major
W. B. Lindsay, of the Engineers, especially distinguished
himself.  The enemy, indeed, threatened a
counter-attack, but their concentrations were, however,
dispersed by our gun-fire.  The enemy, in fact, had
been surprised, and appeared to be dazed by the
suddenness and the success of the onset, and the
various reliefs of the assaulting battalions were
carried out successfully, though under heavy shellfire.
</p>

<p>
It may be pointed out in summarising the action
that no military movement can be realised without a
consideration of its environment.  The advance of
the Canadians to the final counter-assault took place
in the semi-darkness which precedes the dawn.
The wildness of the elements tended to produce
confusion if it added security from observation.
There was enough light to distinguish the features
and uniform of the enemy from our own and to give
the officers a general sense of their direction.  In
the gloomy rainstorm, just before daybreak, the 1st
Division advanced in a long succession of four lines,
one close behind the other, on the frontage of three
companies.  Each regiment maintained its correct
line of attack on the objective; each leading
company was reinforced at the proper moment by the
company which was marching steadily behind.  The
fury of the German shell-fire in no way discomposed
the orderly advance of these disciplined battalions.
In the shadows of the shattered woods which
surrounded them it was easy to be deflected from the
true course by the sudden spurt of machine-gun fire
from an undestroyed emplacement, or to be checked
by bombs thrown by isolated detachments of
Germans.  But the regiments moved steadily forward
in the darkness, over a ground ravaged both by
British and German artillery until no landmarks
remained.  Here and there patches of barbed wire
still stood out to show that a trench had once existed
behind it.  The orders were to use the bayonet until
light came, for fear of firing into the other
detachments.  Through this chaos of shattered trees and
earth the Canadian infantry moved steadily forward,
and as the dawn broke once more on a ruined
countryside it saw the assailants unshaken in
discipline and correct in alignment&mdash;masters once more
of the heights which defend the salient of Ypres.
</p>

<p>
Captain Papineau, of the Corps Staff, on June
16th surveyed the field of battle after the Canadian
Corps had re-established itself in its old positions.
His impressions are well worth recording.  Looking
north from the works which we still maintain on
Hill 60, he was able to survey most of the ground
over which the ebb and flow of battle had raged
during the preceding fortnight.  The first impression was
one of blight&mdash;as though a devastating plague had
suddenly descended upon these woods and fields
and hills, had blotted out the natural green of
Nature, and churned up the earth into sordid masses
of mud.  The blaze of sunshine and the blue sky
flecked with slow-moving clouds could not wipe out
the ugliness of the prospect.  Man had defaced
Nature until the charm of Nature had vanished.
</p>

<p>
Gaunt and grey and menacing, the prospect of the
low hills swept out from the feet of the observers.
Below were the shattered remains of Square Wood
and Armagh Wood.  Observatory Ridge, lost and
recaptured, stood in front, its coppices full of
the memories of hidden machine-guns.  Behind
there peeped out the higher grounds of Hills 61 and
62, to which the remains of Sanctuary Wood still
climbed upwards.  On the right rose Mount Sorrel,
where the grim earth and shattered trunks still met
the clear sky.  Behind, in contrast, the green fields
of high grass stretching towards Ypres ringed this
land of death.  The uncut crops, grown wild, had
attained an unwonted luxuriance.  Here and there
a bunch of scarlet poppies might have drawn
their intense colour from the gallant blood which
had soaked the earth beneath.  The unkempt
hedgerows, no longer tall and neat, ran back to the
city behind, and the beheaded and scarred poplars
remained as mute witnesses to the strife of man.
Yet Nature was attempting to assert herself, and
through this summer's growth of verdure to cover
the riot of battle.
</p>

<p>
Scattered beneath this innocent mantle of green
are innumerable shell holes, old crumbling trenches
full of the memories and odours of death, graves
and graveyards marked by the crosses commemorating
the long-forgotten captains once well loved by
their regiments, and of humble privates perhaps still
remembered.  The torn and trampled equipment, the
empty ammunition boxes, the remains here and there
of shattered bodies, which human care and energy
had been unable to bury, all await the healing tide of
Nature which will cover them in its due time.  On
the roads behind lie the bodies of dead horses, with
the flies thick on their congealed sides, killed in the
effort to bring up to the assaulting battalions the
necessities of war and livelihood.  Yet of these, too,
the poet has written that their cups are the calm
pools and the winding rivers, and that care never
breaks their healthy slumbers.  Even over all that
quiet countryside has come the continued spray of
bursting shells, week after week and month after
month, and if you look closely into every field and
tree and ruined house, every yard of that wide
landscape will show its wounds.  We shall remember
when the time of reckoning comes.
</p>

<p>
Even as the observers watched the field of conflict
on June 16th, sudden clouds like giant powder-puffs
leapt into the sky, and the air carried less swiftly the
sound of bursting shrapnel.  They looked into
Square Wood, which was a wood no longer.  In it
there was no speck of green&mdash;only grey mud, slowly
crusting in the sun, and bare, white, lifeless stalks
to mark what had once been trees.  But against the
sky-line the new Canadian trenches ran, marked by
the new outlines of red earth, to show that we held
once again the lines of Mount Sorrel.  The
experience had been a hard one; the cost of life severe;
the energies of the whole Corps had been required
to balance the advantage the Württembergers had
gained over us in the early days of June, and no
regiment had been exempt from a share in the trial.
Yet the task was accomplished, and defeat was
turned into victory.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap11fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap11fn1text">1</a>] The greatest possible assistance to the attack was given by
Capt. Godwin and the trench mortar batteries of the 1st Division.
These mortars kept up so heavy a fire on Hill 60 that the
enfilade fire which had largely stopped the night attack on
June 3rd was kept down completely.  Capt. Godwin was
unfortunately killed.

<p class="footnote">

[<a href="#chap11fn4text">4</a>] The Staff Direction of General Tuxford's Brigade was

Urquart and Clarke Kennedy.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is more than a year ago since, in the last
chapter of the first volume of "Canada in Flanders,"
these words were written:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"After incredible hardships patiently supported,
after desperate battles stubbornly contested, the
work of the Canadians is still incomplete.  But they
will complete it, meeting new necessities with fresh
exertions, for it is the work of civilisation and of
liberty."  These words still contain some truth in
relation to the conditions of to-day.  The work is
still incomplete.  But in the interval which has
passed the dimensions of the task have wholly
altered.  In this war success depended, as
Mr. Churchill once pointed out, not upon episodes, but
upon tendencies.  And in the last ten months the
tendencies have all marched with the terrible
inevitableness of a Greek tragedy towards the doom
of the Central Powers.
</p>

<p>
In that development the Canadians have played
their part.  They will continue to play it, "meeting
new necessities with fresh exertions," until the
happy day when peace is dictated upon the terms
which the Allies require.  And then they will return
to the farm, the bank, the university, the shop, and
the ranch, as the seven thousand returned who
fought in our South African quarrel.  But is it
possible that they should return without having stamped
upon the loose constitution of the Empire articles
at once more formal and more mutual than those
with which until this war we have on the whole been
content?
</p>

<p>
It does not seem possible, and it is certainly not
desirable, that this remarkable military co-operation
should be so unfruitful in constitutional result.  In
this final chapter of the second volume&mdash;the last
volume in which it is likely that the present writer
will be able to undertake the responsibility of
authorship&mdash;he may perhaps be forgiven if he allows
himself the intrusion of a more personal note than has
been consistent with the scope of that part of the
work which has preceded it.
</p>

<p>
"Canada in Flanders" suggests many reflections
to a mind either acquainted with the past or
imaginative in relation to the future.  It speaks
of achievement; and it also speaks of the agony of
lingering death; it recalls Ypres, which will perhaps
be in the history of Young Canada what Verdun
is in the history of Old France; it recalls, too, the
truncated bodies of the maimed who have offered
the sacrifice of radiant youth and health upon a
shrine the reality of which to them may perhaps
sometimes have seemed a little remote.  "Canada
in Flanders," if confined to the military activities
of Canadians in that unlovable country, would
awake these and many other tragic and glorious
memories.  The pages which precede these words
are a contribution and an effort to do justice to this
branch of the subject.
</p>

<p>
But to the title "Canada in Flanders" must be
conceded the relevance of some other observations
which as a Canadian I think ought to be made,
because it is plain that the Empire is still in an
evolutionary stage; because plans and policies
involving great changes are being boldly canvassed;
because I myself am in favour of great changes;
and, finally, because to see the facts as they really
are is a condition precedent to fruitful development.
</p>

<p>
The first step in such a consideration is to
examine shortly the nature, the significance, and the
inevitable consequences of the Dominion's contribution
to the necessities of this gigantic struggle.
</p>

<p>
The degree of heroism which has been constantly
displayed by Canadians of all ranks will be admitted
by all who have read these pages.  The moral
grandeur of their deeds can only receive justice
from those who keep in mind considerations which
are sometimes overlooked, but which are nevertheless
of immense importance.
</p>

<p>
A very distinguished French General&mdash;a General
than whom none more distinguished has been
discovered by France in this war&mdash;and very few by
any country in any war&mdash;was good enough once to
discuss with me the respective qualities of the
French and British infantry.  Our conversation
took place under circumstances which invited and
won from him both sympathy and candour.  He
spoke of the soldiers of France in words so
eloquent, so full of personal reminiscence, so charged
with emotion, so vibrant with a wholly attractive
pride, that for the first time I fully understood
how deep and how pure are the wells from which
the patriotism of this immortal nation is distilled.
Then he began to speak of the British forces.
Of these he made this penetrating observation: "To
the British of all nations this singular tribute must be
paid: that their infantry has never been engaged in
any protracted war without a universal admission that
it was the equal of any infantry in the world; and
yet that it has never been afforded the supreme
incentive to soldiers, that of fighting on their own
soil, and for their own women and children at the
moment and on the scene of their instant peril.
</p>

<p>
"In Flanders, under Marlborough, in the
Peninsula and at Waterloo, under Wellington, your
infantry have compelled the admiration of the world.
And yet, my friend, they have never responded, as
we have, to this appeal:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Soldiers! facing you are the men who still
occupy the sacred soil of France: who have ravished
your women: and murdered old men, your compatriots.
Soldiers, advance to avenge your country
and those of your blood and race whom a savage
enemy has done to death!'"
</p>

<p>
Deeply moved by a tribute made with so much
feeling, tact, and sympathy, I ventured to ask,
</p>

<p>
"Do not these remarks of yours, General, apply
with even more force to the troops of the great
self-governing Dominions who from so far have
come to sustain with their lives the fortunes of the
Allies upon soil so remote?"
</p>

<p>
His reply stated so clearly and with such insight
the view on which I desire to insist that I venture
to reproduce it.  "Nothing," he said, "in the
history of the world has ever been known quite like
it.  My countrymen are fighting within fifty miles
of Paris to push back and chastise the vile and
leprous race which has violated the chastity of our
beautiful France.  But the Australians at the
Dardanelles and the Canadians at Ypres fought with
supreme and absolute devotion for what to many
of them must have seemed simple abstractions, and
that nation which will support for an abstraction the
horror of this war of all wars, will ever hold the
highest place in the records of human valour."
</p>

<p>
I recall this conversation because it illustrates
my point.
</p>

<p>
In a sense it is true that the majority of
Australian and Canadian soldiers understand generally
that they are fighting for the existence of the Empire,
and in particular for the independence of that part
of the Empire to which each respectively belongs;
but the conclusion can only be a general one, the
outcome rather of intuition than of exact knowledge.
Australia is far, far remote from European quarrels.
Canada has no neighbour but the United States.
The shearer from Australia and the lumberman
from Canada have come to help the Empire; but
they would, I suspect, rather fight for six months
than spend six minutes in attempting a lucid
exposition of the motives which proved decisive to
each individual volunteer.  And, indeed, how could
they&mdash;simple men far away from the heart of the
Empire&mdash;be expected to have grasped the nature
of the German menace when the whole of a great
historic party in England was blind to it six months
before the war broke out?  Was a bank clerk in
Toronto, or a book-keeper in Sydney, or a squatter
in Rhodesia, to appreciate the ultimate tendency of
German policy when the Chairman of the National
Union of Liberal Federations, himself a Privy
Councillor, was declaring that as a business man he
preferred the sanctions of International Law to the
protection of the British Fleet; when members of
Parliament were forming each year a powerful
committee to fight the Naval Estimates; when
official invitations to suspend shipbuilding
programmes gave annual indulgence to the Teuton
sense of humour; when German editors and
professors in yearly deputations exploited the
simplicity of their silly hosts; and when, finally,
statesmen in high places paid periodic and public tribute
to the sincerity and humanity of German <i>Kultur</i>?
</p>

<p>
To ask these questions is to answer them.  The
majority of those who stood to the Colours did so
because they saw that at that moment the Empire
was in peril.  The circumstance that neither they
nor their leaders were responsible for the policy
which brought us, wholly unprepared on the military
side, to the most gigantic struggle in history,
seemed to them no sufficient reason for refusing to
fight while the fight lasted.  But it may be pointed
out that many of their leaders had a very clear
vision of the dangers in our path.  They saw the
European situation from a distance, and perhaps for
that reason in truer perspective.  Mr. Hughes, the
Prime Minister of Australia, who unites with
profound knowledge of affairs dauntless courage and
the analytical power of a trained mind, has
always believed this struggle must come.  General
Botha&mdash;in many ways the most romantic figure in
the Empire to-day&mdash;adroit politician, skilful general,
chivalrous soldier, faithful friend&mdash;returned from a
visit to the German Army manoeuvres some years
ago with the same apprehension branded upon his
mind.  Sir Robert Borden, only four years ago, in
introducing his naval proposals in the Canadian
Parliament, used these prophetic words:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"But to-day while the clouds are heavy, and we
hear the booming of the distant thunder, and see
the lightning flash above the horizon, we cannot and
we will not wait and deliberate until the impending
storm has burst upon us in fury and with disaster."
</p>

<p>
The leaders, then, of political thought in the
Dominions had arrived at sound conclusions by
observation and inference from known facts.  And
having formed these conclusions, they decided,
when war came, to throw their whole strength into
the scale, though they were well aware of the errors
of judgment that had paralysed preparation in
England.  The rank and file volunteered in
hundreds of thousands, and then in more hundreds of
thousands, because they saw that recrimination as
to past responsibility was at that moment futile, and
that there and then the Empire was in mortal peril.
From thousands of miles the flower of the youth of
the Empire have come and trained, and fought and
died, or have drifted back broken after the war to
the Dominions whence they set out.  And the men
who have done these things, uncompelled and
uncompellable, have accepted our military and
diplomatic direction of the war, even when they disagreed
with it, without question and without complaint.
Nothing nobler has been uttered in the war than
the answer, made in the Australian Parliament, by
the Prime Minister to a Member who gave expression
to the bitter grief with which Australia learned
of the definite abandonment of the Dardanelles
adventure.
</p>

<p>
"Not upon us," said he, "have these great
burdens and responsibilities been cast.  Not by one
word or even one doubt will I add to the anxieties
of those from whom decisions have been required."
</p>

<p>
It is a commonplace that no such phenomenon
as the great rally of the Dominions has ever
been witnessed in history.  None of the Great
Empires of the world has ever conceded so much
freedom to its constituent parts or been rewarded
by so much devotion.  And it is well known that
the whole world&mdash;our friends and our enemies
alike&mdash;have been amazed at the spectacle of Imperial
solidarity which the war has exhibited.  "For the
purposes of a European war," wrote one of
Germany's many military philosophers, "the British
Colonies, even if they remain faithful, may be
ignored."  To-day this gallant theorist&mdash;the
nursling of Treitschke&mdash;is, one may presume, somewhat
better informed.
</p>

<p>
It may perhaps be urged that, after all, the very
co-operation of which so much has been said has
become possible under the undefined, impalpable,
and sentimental Union which has hitherto prevailed
throughout the Empire; that the task of translating
in the twin fields of Defence and Diplomacy
informal into formal representations of the Dominions
is very hard to reconcile with the complete domestic
independence of each unit; and that all our most
valuable constitutional doctrines have been the fruit
of an evolutionary and not of a conscious or studied
process.  This is true.  But it ignores a real peril
to the Empire.  In all things physical, mental,
and moral, great activities are followed by great
reactions.  And the violence of the reaction is
generally determined by the violence of the
activity.  The efforts made by all parties in this
War have been stupendous.  It is certain that these
exertions will be followed in every belligerent
country by violent reactions.  The Dominions
will not escape the influence of these currents of
opinion.  "The captains and the kings depart,"
but there remain the memory of the dead, the
presence everywhere of the maimed, and perhaps to
many of the bereaved the anxiety of financial
pressure.  Canada has been and is overwhelmingly loyal,
but none the less a student of Imperial affairs should
give attention to the recent correspondence
between Mr. Bourassa and Capt. Papineau.  Similar
problems survive even the immense influence and
prestige of General Botha in South Africa.  In
Australia and New Zealand the loyalty which is
endemic in these stubborn and homogeneous
peoples is reinforced by obvious local inducements
to a centripetal policy.  But even here there are
forces which at a time of reaction are certain to
become both articulate and critical.  In measuring
the probable extent and seriousness of such a
reaction the student of politics will not forget the lessons
of the South African War.  The glamour of war is
dissipated: material gains are forgotten: there
survive commercial and industrial dislocations, the
stale but strident advertisement of war scandals, and
the abiding, grinding pressure of war taxation.  The
khaki election in England was followed by the
<i>débâcle</i> of 1906, and by the accession to power of
a Parliament which consisted to a greater extent
than any House of Commons which had ever
existed in England of pacifists, idealists, and
demagogues to whom not only the thought of war, but
even of preparation for war, was abhorrent.
</p>

<p>
But the country in which this reaction against the
South African War took place was, after all, the
country whose Government, elected by themselves,
was responsible for the diplomacy which led up to
that war and for the conduct of the war when once
it was declared.  The danger in the case of the
self-governing Dominions is that the reaction is
certain to be supported by opponents of the War
with the argument that those who have made
contributions relatively so immense were never
consulted as to the policy, and have merely been called
in to support the consequences of other men's
bungling.  It is sufficient to say that such a
campaign might become formidable.
</p>

<p>
There is only one remedy.  It is not attempted
here to work out the details; and, indeed, their
elaboration might most usefully engage the exclusive
work of the twelve ablest statesmen in the united
Empire.  But without making any such attempt, it
may be broadly claimed that both in the interests
of the Mother Country and of the Dominions,
and of that Empire of which they are equally the
legatees, the close of the War will mark the moment
when the claim of Sir Robert Borden, "Admit us
to your councils," will become irresistible.  It is
important that this claim should be recognised now.
With every year that passes it will become more
important.  The Dominions have played a great
part in this War and one which will never be
forgotten.  But they are still in their infancy.  Their
adult strength has yet to be tested.  There may
never be another world struggle.  Should such an
occasion unhappily arise, it is at least likely to be
remote in time.  And the more remote it be, the
more decisive is the part which our kinsmen in the
Outer Empire may hope to play.
</p>

<p>
Do not, at least, let us fail in the attempt to keep
our friends for want of imagination.
</p>

<p>
Burke, in a splendid and memorable passage,
dealing with those Colonies which the folly of our
ancestors lost, spoke to a deaf audience of the swift
development of our old American Colonies:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Whether I put the present numbers too high or
too low is a matter of little moment.  Such is the
strength with which population shoots in that part
of the world that, state the numbers as high as we
will, whilst the dispute continues, the exaggeration
ends.  Whilst we are discussing any given magnitude
they are grown to it.  Whilst we spend our time
in deliberating on the mode of governing 2,000,000
we shall find we have millions more to manage.
Your children do not grow faster from infancy to
manhood than they spread from families to
communities, and from villages to nations."
</p>

<p>
Such will be the growth of these great
communities which have given us their lives in this War.
Let us welcome, and, if it be possible, let us increase
their proven attachment.  Nor let us for one
moment forget, among the great tasks with which
peace will confront us, that the reorganisation of
our Imperial resources is the first constructive task
which awaits the statesmen of the Empire.  If this
indeed be realised, the work will not have been done
in vain which has been done by "Canada in
Flanders."

APPENDIX.
</h3>

<p>
Extracts from the third supplement of the
<i>London Gazette</i> of Friday, May 29th, 1916.  In
the Despatch from Sir Douglas Haig, G.C.B.,
Commander-in-Chief British Forces in France, of May
19th, the following references are made to the
Canadian troops:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
SECTION 10.
</p>

<p>
During the period under review the forces under
my command have been considerably augmented by
the arrival of new formations from home, and the
transfer of others released from service in the Near
East.  This increase has made possible the relief
of a French Army, to which I have already referred,
at the time of the Battle of Verdun.  Among the
newly arrived forces is the "Anzac" Corps.  With
them, the Canadians, and a portion of the South
African Overseas Force which has also arrived, the
Dominions now furnish a valuable part of the
Imperial Forces in France.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
SECTION 8.
</p>

<p>
The following units were specially brought to
the notice of the Commander-in-Chief for good
work in carrying out or repelling local attacks an
raids:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  1st Divisional Artillery,<br />
  22nd Canadian Howitzer Brigade,<br />
  5th Canadian Infantry Battalion,<br />
  7th Canadian Infantry Battalion,<br />
  29th Canadian Infantry Battalion,<br />
  49th Canadian Infantry Battalion.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
SECTION 6.
</p>

<p class="t3">
St. Eloi.
</p>

<p>
6.  On March 27th our troops made an attack with
the object of straightening out the line at St. Eloi,
and cutting away the small German salient which
encroached on the semicircle of our line in the
Ypres salient to a depth of about 100 yards over
a front of some 600 yards.  The operation was
begun by the firing of six very large mines; the
charge was so heavy that the explosion was felt in
towns several miles behind the lines, and large
numbers of the enemy were killed.  Half a minute
after the explosion our infantry attack was launched,
aiming at the German Second Line.  The right
attack met with little opposition, and captured its
assigned objective; but the left attack was not so
successful, and a gap was left in possession of the
Germans, through which they entered one of the
craters.  The following days were spent by both
sides in heavy bombardment and in unsuccessful
attacks, intended on our part to capture the
remaining trenches, and on the part of the Germans to
drive us from the positions we had occupied.  In
the very early morning of April 3rd we succeeded
in recapturing the crater and the trenches still held
by the enemy, thereby securing the whole of our
original objective.  We had, moreover, captured
five officers and 195 men in the first attack on March
27th, and five officers and 80 men in the attack on
April 3rd.  The work of consolidating our new
position, however, proved extremely difficult, owing
to the wet soil, heavy shelling and mine explosions;
though pumps were brought up and efforts at
draining were instituted, the result achieved was
comparatively small.  By dint of much heavy work the
Brigade holding these trenches succeeded in
reducing the water in the trenches by two feet by the
morning of the 5th.  This state of affairs could not,
even so, be regarded as satisfactory; and during the
5th the enemy's bombardment increased in intensity,
and the new trenches practically ceased to exist.
On the morning of the 6th the enemy attacked with
one battalion supported by another; he penetrated
our new line, and gained the two westernmost craters.
It is difficult to follow in detail the fighting of the
next three weeks, which consisted in repeated attacks
by both sides on more or less isolated mine craters,
the trench lines having been destroyed by shell fire.
Great efforts were made to maintain communication
with the garrisons of these advanced posts, and with
considerable success.  But there were periods of
uncertainty, and some misconception as to the state
of affairs arose.  On the 11th it was reported to me
that we had recaptured all that remained of the
position won by us on March 27th and April 3rd.
This report, probably due to old craters having been
mistaken for new ones, was subsequently found to
be incorrect.  The new craters, being exposed to
the enemy's view and to the full weight of his
artillery fire, have proved untenable, and at the
present time our troops are occupying trenches
roughly in the general line which was held by them
before the 27th.
</p>

<p>
In a subsequent despatch, dated December 23rd,
1916, issued in a Supplement to the London Gazette
of December 29th, the following references to
the activities of Canadian troops during June
appears:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
While my final preparations were in progress
the enemy made two unsuccessful attempts to
interfere with my arrangements.  The first,
directed on May 21st against our positions on
the Vimy Ridge, south and south-east of
Souchez, resulted in a small enemy gain of no
strategic or tactical importance; and rather than
weaken my offensive by involving additional
troops in the task of recovering the lost ground,
I decided to consolidate a position in rear of our
original line.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The second enemy attack was delivered on
June 2nd on a front of over one and a half miles
from Mount Sorrel to Hooge, and succeeded in
penetrating to a maximum depth of 700 yards.
As the southern part of the lost position
commanded our trenches, I judged it necessary to
recover it, and by an attack launched on June
13th, carefully prepared and well executed, this
was successfully accomplished by the troops on
the spot.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Neither of these enemy attacks succeeded in
delaying the preparations for the major
operations which I had in view.
